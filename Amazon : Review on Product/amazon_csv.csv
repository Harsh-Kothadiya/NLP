  Lo primero, he de decir que esta opinión es la de un comprador real, nadie me ha pagado por ella ni me ha ofrecido productos gratis. Lo digo porque le pongo 5 estrellas al Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro de 6 GB de RAM y 128 GB de almacenamiento interno.Adquirido hace un par de semanas, he de decir que el teléfono me está resultando tan satisfactorio como mi anterior Huawei P30 Lite caído en acto de servicio, pero con el añadido de más memoria RAM, un procesador más potente y una pantalla mayor. No se calienta nada, el sensor de huellas lateral funciona a la perfección, el reconocimiento facial va como un tiro y el conjunto de cámaras es más que satisfactorio. Puedes hacer fotos incluso a máximo de resolución (108 mpx) y luego hacer recortes pudiendo así suplir perfectamente la falta de un pequeño zoom óptico. Los juegos se ejecutan sin problemas y el streaming va muy fluido. La carga de su batería de 5.000 mAh es muy rápida y el NFC funciona a la perfección.De momento, estoy muy satisfecho.

  Spedizione ottima, ordinato domenica e ricevuto martedì. Aveva un'app di Windtre installata, non ho capito se si tratti di una versione brandizzata o globale, ad ogni modo aveva solo quella, è bastato rimuoverla. Telefono piuttosto grande con un'ottima fotocamera ed una buona usabilità per uso quotidiano, schermo amoled davvero stupendo. Peccato che non ci sia l'opzione per disabilitare la ricarica rapida, bisognerebbe procurarsi un caricatore più lento a parte. Vedremo se riscontrerò il tanto discusso problema al sensore di prossimità, avendo effettuato solo poche telefonate finora non l’ho riscontrato, ma non è escluso che lo riscontri. Si spera che questi problemi vengano risolti al più presto con gli aggiornamenti della Miui.

  Overall I have this phone now for a few days and it's good. The battery is great it works fine but there is one major problem I think (that's the reason for one star) and it's the fact that when you're on a call the screen is not turned off and you can push some buttons with your face. It happened to me that it mutes my call or turn on the loudspeaker or put the call on hold to that is a major issue for me that shows this product is not mature enough. I'm quite disappointed. Otherwise for the rest it does the job so far.

  La cosa che mi ha dato sui nervi (e appartentemente non c'è rimedio) è il sensore di prossimità che disattiva lo schermo durante le chiamate che non funziona MAI bene, attivando cose a caso (spesso se lo si tiene con la spalla impazzisce e a volte si stacca la chiamata, si attiva il mute o inspiegabilmente si attiva il flash della fotocamera (PERCHÈ?!), creandomi non pochi disagi anche con gli audio di Whatsapp. Per il resto sono abbastanza soddisfatto: batteria dura quasi due giorni pieni (utilizzando in prevalenza social e con l'hotspot acceso almeno 3 ore al giorno), fotocamera che non fa troppo rimpiangere il top di gamma Mi10T e processore scattante ne fanno un ottimo fascia media. Lo schermo è molto brillante essendo un super AMOLED. Altri difetti? le fotocamere sporgono come un balcone e c'è bisogno di una cover abbastanza importante per evitare che si fracassino; il già citato SENSORE DI PROSSIMITA' e la qualità delle foto al buio rispeto ad altri concorrenti di fascia media; ottima la camera grandangolare e super-grandangolare. Valido nel complesso ma delusione totale per il sensore sopra citato. Amazon una garanzia: arrivato in anticipo e ben imballato, 4 stelle.

  Había comprado el celular con TELMOV por medio de Amazon y tuvieron el mal tino de pegarle a la caja santo y seña del celular, es decir, qué modelo es y cuánto costó, así que los amantes de lo ajeno sacaron el celular de la caja y a mí me entregaron una caja vacía. Amazon hasta el momento no me ha hecho reembolso de mi dinero. Ahora lo volví a comprar, con otro vendedor y la caja llegó con los sellos de Amazón, el celular super bien, en su cajita sellada y todo, no era el color verde degradado, pero este verdecito me gustó. Al principio se calentó muchísimo en la parte de arriba, específicamente en donde están las cámaras, pero después de unas horas de uso ya se normalizó y está funcionando super bien. La carga es rapidísima, el cargador es americano y en general es un buen producto en cuestión de costo-beneficio. Estoy casada con Xiaomi que trae buenos terminales a precios competitivos. Ahora sí estoy satisfecha con mi compra.

  This thing is my absolute favorite. I bought the phone because I was long overdue for an upgrade. My last phone was already kind of old when I bought it years ago. This phone is a fantastic little device. It does just about everything the high-end phones do for a quarter of the price. Between the 4K display and 64Mp camera, I can't complain much! If I had to warn you about anything, it's the slowmo feature. Yes, the slowmo works, but it only slows down the last quarter of a 10 second video. If you're bad at math, that's 2.5 seconds.The camera is phenomenal, though, and the phone is incredibly responsive. The display is gorgeous, the back of the phone is so pretty I decided on a clear case so as not to hide it. I'm afraid I'm going to break this thing, but I know it is absolutely worth more than they're asking for it. Xiaomi did a fantastic job on the Redmi Note 9 Pro

"
75,"

  I had this phone for 4 days, and in those 4 days, my thoughts on it have changed. Day 1 the phone arrived and it's lovely piece of equipment. I ordered the green, it's a nice size and weight: the screen looked narrower  and shorter than my galaxy note 9,  but my galaxy fit into the redmi case, so...PROSScreen size is good for me.The phone has a good weight to it.Side fingerprint detection button is novel to me.The graphics for the games I play were good.It connected well with my at&t wifi.The overall look was pleasing to me.CONSI couldn't get all my incoming calls. If callers didn't leave a voice message or text, I would never have known they called.Call quality was poor. The people could barely hear me.The speaker(s) are subpar in my opinion. Not loud enough. You also definitely need a good equalizer on there.It literally took 45 seconds to hear the line ring after the number was dialed. On EVERY call I made.Honestly if the redmi would do the basic phone function (making and receiving calls), I'd consider keeping it. I don't get a lot of people calling me every day but I expect that I can receive calls if they do come in, and an unlocked GSM  phone is expected to function properly with my carrier (t-mobile), so that was a deal breaker for me.

"

  I love this phone it shouldn't be $250 it is worth sooo much more than it even gets praise for the camera is of course not a full 64mp it stacks images to get there but it's the cleanest 64mp camera I've ever seen under $500 it's battery is amazing after I took it out of the box it lasted me 2 and a half days and I don't have any problems with it it's fingerprint reader is picky which is amazing that just means it's not gonna let that much more error come in it's just an all around great phone especially for gaming it can do whatever you want with little to no latency

  I like owning my phone but not paying a huge price. I bought a Samsung A70 I liked the phone but the finger print scanner was crap. So I tried going through Samsung for help I was told it's a known issue but since I bought a universal phone it wasn't covered. Then the screen broke and I was like YAY new phone time. I bought this phone after reading up on the reviews and comparing the specs. I recommend this phone 100 %. I can't speak highly enough. It has a bright screen crystal clear. The camera is everything I want in a camera. It runs my Apps perfectly and games very well. Buy it!!

  The hardware is good. Snapdragon 720G, 128GB + 6GB, 2400 x 1080 FHD+, 64MP camera, etc.Major issue is that Xiaomi decided to take a dump on all those, and equip the phone with bad iPhone knock off Launcher that totally lacks affinity with Android. Bloatware they put on the phone make it even worse as you cannot even hide them without using bloatware of their own as the launcher lacks basic stock functionalities.It's just ridiculous to replace stock software with inferior home brew bloatware/flexware. I wish they understand that Android phone buyers actually want Android phones, not a knock off iPhone.

  Es un celular excelente por el precio, buena inversion si no tienes un redmi 8 pro. No me gusto la camara porque sobresale del celular pero con una  carcaza ya no se nota. Funciona rapido, toma buenas fotos, le dura mucho la bateria, pantalla gigante. Tardare buen tiempo con este celular.

  The phone takes 5-6 hours to be charged completely, whereas online reviews say it should take only about 2 hours. Also, the battery life is very short. I am afraid that this is a fake version.

"
82,"

  So I actually LOVE this phone but unfortunately the few issues I've been having with it area deal breakers so I am returning it.The good:The camera is AMAZING. Seriously if I could get past the calling issues, I would keep it for this feature alone.The screen is bright and crisp and had phenomenal color display.The battery is top notch - one charge lasted me 2.5 days of moderate to high use.The bad:The screen phantom touches sometimes when you haven't actually touched the screen (like if you hover, it thinks you tapped, which can be pretty annoying).The deal breaker:It's not supported by most carriers in my area. Verizon and Tmobile would not accept the IMEI and would not guarantee device would work on their networks because it's a global/international version, and not made for the US. AT&T said it would work based on IMEI so I ordered their SIM and put it in my old iphone 7 until my Redmi arrived (note: the SIM gave me 3 bars of LTE coverage on the iphone)... Insert it into the Redmi and it immediately dropped to one bar of service and intermittently would lose service completely. I thought I could get over the crummy service, but after I activated the wifi calling (per instructions I found online) I still wasn't able to receive calls while at home. I spent HOURS on the phone with both AT&T tech support and Amazon's support feature, but it still won't make or receive calls over wifi.. because of this, and the fact it is diminishing my  cell reception, I can't make or receive calls about 60-75% of the time. That IS a deal breaker for me, so it's back in the box and going back unfortunately.Wish they would make a US model already!!

"
83,"

  So far so good. Swapping out my existing phone on Metro was okay. Huge warnings on package that this device will not work on Verizon-type carriers and to return phone right away without opening, so all the Verizon whiners shouldn't be moaning about this - they were warned. There are two sim slots, use the slot closest to the memory card, as that will be your first IMEI number on the back of the phone. The fingerprint reader is built into the power button, which is nifty. Display looks fine and speed is fine as well. Camera seems alright but I need to mess with that more. I was tired of slower phones with 4g ram and slower cpus, this phone has the 6g ram and a spry 720 Snapdragon, which checks off those two boxes for me. The price is far less than a Samsung. 8/29 update - One downer I have found is that this phone does not support wireless calling. womp womp UPDATE 4/11/21 - Phone has had no issues, performance has been fine. I recommend this phone if you are looking for a quality phone at this price point.

This phone is a fantastic little device. It does just about everything the high-end phones do for a quarter of the price. Between the 4K display and 64Mp camera, I can't complain much! If I had to warn you about anything, it's the slowmo feature. Yes, the slowmo works, but it only slows down the last quarter of a 10 second video. If you're bad at math, that's 2.5 seconds.The camera is phenomenal, though, and the phone is incredibly responsive. The display is gorgeous, the back of the phone is so pretty I decided on a clear case so as not to hide it. I'm afraid I'm going to break this thing, but I know it is absolutely worth more than they're asking for it. Xiaomi did a fantastic job on the Redmi Note 9 Pro

  I had this phone for 4 days, and in those 4 days, my thoughts on it have changed. Day 1 the phone arrived and it's lovely piece of equipment. I ordered the green, it's a nice size and weight: the screen looked narrower  and shorter than my galaxy note 9,  but my galaxy fit into the redmi case, so...PROSScreen size is good for me.The phone has a good weight to it.Side fingerprint detection button is novel to me.The graphics for the games I play were good.It connected well with my at&t wifi.The overall look was pleasing to me.CONSI couldn't get all my incoming calls. If callers didn't leave a voice message or text, I would never have known they called.Call quality was poor. The people could barely hear me.The speaker(s) are subpar in my opinion. Not loud enough. You also definitely need a good equalizer on there.It literally took 45 seconds to hear the line ring after the number was dialed. On EVERY call I made.Honestly if the redmi would do the basic phone function (making and receiving calls), I'd consider keeping it. I don't get a lot of people calling me every day but I expect that I can receive calls if they do come in, and an unlocked GSM  phone is expected to function properly with my carrier (t-mobile), so that was a deal breaker for me.

  I love this phone it shouldn't be $250 it is worth sooo much more than it even gets praise for the camera is of course not a full 64mp it stacks images to get there but it's the cleanest 64mp camera I've ever seen under $500 it's battery is amazing after I took it out of the box it lasted me 2 and a half days and I don't have any problems with it it's fingerprint reader is picky which is amazing that just means it's not gonna let that much more error come in it's just an all around great phone especially for gaming it can do whatever you want with little to no latency

  I like owning my phone but not paying a huge price. I bought a Samsung A70 I liked the phone but the finger print scanner was crap. So I tried going through Samsung for help I was told it's a known issue but since I bought a universal phone it wasn't covered. Then the screen broke and I was like YAY new phone time. I bought this phone after reading up on the reviews and comparing the specs. I recommend this phone 100 %. I can't speak highly enough. It has a bright screen crystal clear. The camera is everything I want in a camera. It runs my Apps perfectly and games very well. Buy it!!

  The hardware is good. Snapdragon 720G, 128GB + 6GB, 2400 x 1080 FHD+, 64MP camera, etc.Major issue is that Xiaomi decided to take a dump on all those, and equip the phone with bad iPhone knock off Launcher that totally lacks affinity with Android. Bloatware they put on the phone make it even worse as you cannot even hide them without using bloatware of their own as the launcher lacks basic stock functionalities.It's just ridiculous to replace stock software with inferior home brew bloatware/flexware. I wish they understand that Android phone buyers actually want Android phones, not a knock off iPhone.

  Es un celular excelente por el precio, buena inversion si no tienes un redmi 8 pro. No me gusto la camara porque sobresale del celular pero con una  carcaza ya no se nota. Funciona rapido, toma buenas fotos, le dura mucho la bateria, pantalla gigante. Tardare buen tiempo con este celular.

  The phone takes 5-6 hours to be charged completely, whereas online reviews say it should take only about 2 hours. Also, the battery life is very short. I am afraid that this is a fake version.

  So I actually LOVE this phone but unfortunately the few issues I've been having with it area deal breakers so I am returning it.The good:The camera is AMAZING. Seriously if I could get past the calling issues, I would keep it for this feature alone.The screen is bright and crisp and had phenomenal color display.The battery is top notch - one charge lasted me 2.5 days of moderate to high use.The bad:The screen phantom touches sometimes when you haven't actually touched the screen (like if you hover, it thinks you tapped, which can be pretty annoying).The deal breaker:It's not supported by most carriers in my area. Verizon and Tmobile would not accept the IMEI and would not guarantee device would work on their networks because it's a global/international version, and not made for the US. AT&T said it would work based on IMEI so I ordered their SIM and put it in my old iphone 7 until my Redmi arrived (note: the SIM gave me 3 bars of LTE coverage on the iphone)... Insert it into the Redmi and it immediately dropped to one bar of service and intermittently would lose service completely. I thought I could get over the crummy service, but after I activated the wifi calling (per instructions I found online) I still wasn't able to receive calls while at home. I spent HOURS on the phone with both AT&T tech support and Amazon's support feature, but it still won't make or receive calls over wifi.. because of this, and the fact it is diminishing my  cell reception, I can't make or receive calls about 60-75% of the time. That IS a deal breaker for me, so it's back in the box and going back unfortunately.Wish they would make a US model already!!

  So far so good. Swapping out my existing phone on Metro was okay. Huge warnings on package that this device will not work on Verizon-type carriers and to return phone right away without opening, so all the Verizon whiners shouldn't be moaning about this - they were warned. There are two sim slots, use the slot closest to the memory card, as that will be your first IMEI number on the back of the phone. The fingerprint reader is built into the power button, which is nifty. Display looks fine and speed is fine as well. Camera seems alright but I need to mess with that more. I was tired of slower phones with 4g ram and slower cpus, this phone has the 6g ram and a spry 720 Snapdragon, which checks off those two boxes for me. The price is far less than a Samsung. 8/29 update - One downer I have found is that this phone does not support wireless calling. womp womp UPDATE 4/11/21 - Phone has had no issues, performance has been fine. I recommend this phone if you are looking for a quality phone at this price point.

  Fast Shipping, shipped brand new in the package. Mine came with a clear case, also came with a European charger only, which is okay, I have a USA spare charger.Other than that, Amazing phone! It's beautiful, not to big, but it IS heavy.Carrier: I have T-Mobile (Wingalpha.com) - I was a bit worried that it wouldn't work with my service. But it did! My anxiety was gone once I put my SIM in and set it up and it worked flawless.Definitely recommend!P.s- it comes with a pre-installed screen protector. I normally don't like them but I haven't noticed any issues with it; so it's not a big deal.Update: it's been almost 6 months with the phone. Still no issues what so ever! Still love it!

  From a loyal LG customer, last was the LG V30 with amazing sound, video and camera quality.  But the ram, memory and battery life started lacking.  The Note 9 Pro beats it in spades.  Battery life is the best part of the phone.  I've had used it 3 days straight with mobile data constantly on before recharging.  Never spent more than $300 on a phone as I always buy one or two generations behind.But it's not without its quirks.  And it may be unfair to compare it to the 3 year old LG V30.Firstly it's a Chinese phone so there may be a security risk.  Lately I've had emails from Venmo about unauthorized sign-ins since using the phone.  But that could be another data breach.Secondly, the UI is very basic.  MIUI on android 10 is not very customizable.  From a 3 year old Flagship LG V30 the Note 9 Pro is lacking.  Can't control game graphics and frame rate like the V30 running on android 9.  But it's moot since the battery is so big.  One cool feature is running 2 apps in split screen top/bottom and 50/50 or 66/33 or 33/66 size.  The V30 was able to do that.  But you can drag an app out and have it float on a corner as a window.  Also can't change the aspect ratio or the resolution of the screenThirdly, even though it's unlocked you have to make sure your carrier bands are supported.  I'm with T-Mobile and most bands are supported but still had to create a custom APN (look it up) to send/receive txts and mms txts.  The APN on my sim card was not fully compatible.  Also if I don't keep mobile data on there's no guarantee of incoming/outgoing calls.  But come January 2021 T-Mobile subscribers will only be able to make VoLTE calls.  I also seem to get 3G speeds even though LTE is indicated is connected and indicated on status bar.  If you dig around settings you can see downstream speeds on status bar.  Wifi is no issue.Fourthly, no wifi calling.  Looked everywhere but can't seem to find it.  And can't send/receive txts over wifi which my old phone could do in case I didn't have a cell signal.Fifth, minor things like the screen aspect ratio is too tall, 20:9 I think.  And it's LCD not OLED like my old phone.  Light does bleed thru on top right hand corner.  Battery life and brightness is not an issue because the battery is big.  I still prefer OLED for better blacks and grays and no light bleeding.Sixth, transferring apps and accounts is not as seamless as with LG.  Every generation LG phone allowed me to transfer and restore all my apps, accounts, email and settings with little follow up thru it's mobile app.  It's the main reason I stuck with LG for so long.  On the Redmi I was only able to transfer and restore my Google account and some apps.  Had to sign in to most of my accounts again unlike the seamlessness of LG app/account restore process.I know I've focused on the negatives but the positives speak for themselves.  For instance the rear camera is amazing at 64 mp and you can record 4k video if you have the memory.Conclusion, this will be my holdover phone until I upgrade to a 5G.  Either it will be another Redmi or I'll go back to LG when the price is right.Edit: 12-16-20.  Forgot to mention no wireless charging and it's not waterproof, the V30 has it.  But there is a headphone jack.Side note, when I read reviews I usually read the bad reviews first that's why the review skews negative but it isn't so.  There are many features that are not covered more readily explained from other reviews so I won't be repeating them.

  So I was a little nervous ordering this phone, as I've had a Samsung Note phone for the last 5 years. I was honestly tired of paying $1k per phone,so I started researching more affordable alternatives and came across Xiaomi Redmi and read all the great reviews and decided to give it's go.  I can definitely say, I am not at all disappointed in my decision. I'm quite happy I got this phone, it can definitely go head to head with any top notch phone and gives Samsung a run for their money. I will never buy another Samsung with this far better alternative. The specs, quality and camera... all you get for a 1/4 of the price. Thank you Xiaomi!! You are the Robin Hood of premium phones for the poor and the frugal.

I have been using it for 2 weeks only, but everything works to my standards. It is bigger than my last phone Huawei (that I started having problems with due to being banned in US ?) but hence the ""Note"" phone. I like bigger display, as it is  better to see photos and browse the internet. The side fingerprint sensor works well. Battery life lasts 2.5 days with normal usage. Photos are also nice quality. People can hear me and I can hear them nicely as well. Seller shipped very fast, it came in within 2 days with standard shipping.

  Worth every penny. You can't expect the experience like samsung or Apple  from a 250 bucks phone. But at this price you won't be disappointed too. Although it is equipped with an IPS lcd display honestly i found it as equal to an amoled panels. Camera is fantastic needs some improvement though by software update. Battery life is tooooooo loooooong. Lasts for 3days of Moderate usage.Cons: speaker is like a joke. It sounds like a cheap Chinese radio.The most important thing i'd like to mention that xiaomi said now they have a new improved vibration motor for better haptic feedback but  on that one is worse than ever. . Even for more now they have removed the option to adjust vibration intensity  like soft , medium to hi tapping on the screen. So there is no way to adjust haptic feedback strength. All you have to stuck with default and it's seriously annoying.

  I bought Xiaomi Redmi note 9 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 pro 2 phones, as a tablet, they are great, with large capacity batteries, fast processor is very comfortable to use. As a phone, completely unqualified. I USE T-Mobile network, I used to  have normal phone signals at home, but  this phone reception signal was very weak in my home .Many times I cannot make and receive calls at home. When the phone is connected, it is often intermittent. sometimes the call is automatically interrupted.  What I want is a phone, not a tablet.

  The phone is a very good value for the money and punches well above its price point, but in some ways, you get what you pay for.The good: Great battery life, large screen, good cameras, smooth UI, very quick.The bad: The screen could be better, it's slightly dark and the colors don't quite pop like on true flagship phones. By far the biggest issue though is the frequent wifi outages. Sometimes wifi shows connected, sometimes disconnected, but I can expect wifi to stop working every 30 minutes or so. It happens across all wifi networks, factory reset didn't fix it, updated miui didn't fix it either. If you don't have unlimited data, beware.

  I originally bought a xiaomi phone in January 2018 to replace my non-uogradeable Blu Pure XL. Xioami phone was light-years better. Unfortunately a shattered screen meant having to buy a new phone. I went with xiaomi Note 9 pro  global (US edition only it seems was available). It is a sad comparison to my old xiaomi. The one gesture I relied on most was the  native phone recording which made crystal clear  recordings of the conversation automatically. This feature is not available in the US version, apparently the is to Google and what I assume a  lobbying campaign to stifle their Chinese competition. Further evidence  to indicate this is that xiaomi phone users were left with Google.srticlrs to install Google's ""native"" call support which really only activates the sound recorder and catches only YOUR voice with a faint whisper  of the caller you can barely hear as the recorder is in the mouth piece and tries to hear the caller which is heard through the ear piece of the phone, the same failed recording option I had on my Blu Pure Xl. Also, the camera which hails as being better than my previous Xiaomi phone isn't. Save your money, just buy a comparable low end American phone.

  The Redmi Note 9 Pro was a decent phone in other respects (before I had to return it), but save your time trying to enable Wifi calling--the option is absent from the settings, where you'd find it on other Android phones.  I found a roundabout way to check that VoWifi was enabled, but apparently this is different from T-Mobile's Wifi Calling (at least in the U.S.?). The T-Mobile tech staff was unable to help. I've read that this phone's VoWifi works with some international carriers--Jio and AirTel.  Considering this is advertised as an unlocked, T-Mobile compatible phone, it should be made clear that Wifi calling through T-Mobile in the U.S. doesn't work.

  I absolutely love this phone. Where do I start? It has specs which rival the flagship models of any brand out there, including the Samsung Note 20+ (although it has very little in common with the Note series - no stylus for one - so the name is misleading). 6 gigs of RAM, Octacore processor, a 64mb (!!!) quad lens camera that shoots beautiful, high resolution photos, 2 sim card slots, expandable memory via a MicroSD card slot, a huge, nearly bezel-less/infinity screen (not curved like the Note or S series but that didn't bother me, despite being a Samsung geek for the last ten years), and a HUGE 5000mAh battery (I can wake up with a full charge and wring this things neck all day - browsing the web, watching YouTube, watching a movie or 2 on Prime or Netflix, doing whatever else constitutes being ""glued to your phone all day""... By the time the day is through I will typically have 20-30% of battery life remaining whereas my Note8 (3000mAh) required being on the charger several times throughout. As expected due to the impressive specs the phone is extremely fast.. It reboots completely in seconds, there's no noticeable lag when opening / closing apps (including apps that tax the RAM and processor such as HD games, video players etc) as well as when multiple apps are running in the background.There aren't many cons and none are deal breakers, espec at this price, but it's worth mentioning that the phone is very heavy and the back is *somewhat* bulky. It's possible I've just been spoiled by the all glass construction of the later Samsung Note models, for all I know it's weight and bulk is consistent with the flagship models of most other brands. I only mention the weight and bulk *relative to the Note 8 I've been using for 3 years*.. After a week of using it I am not bothered by either.TL;DR - This is a powerful device that can go toe to toe with any other brand's flagship  for only $240. The camera, screen, and battery life are second to none. It's doubtful that you'll find it's equal for under $800, and it absolutely destroys anything in it's price point. But don't buy it because it's ""cheap"", buy it because it's a fantastic device and an incredible value.

  Upgrading from a Xiaomi Mi A1 and this has so many features.  Not a fan of stock apps so I debloated (google it) and everything is running smoothly.  The camera is so versatile!  The video stabilization is great, zoom looks awesome until about 5x but can actually go out to 0.6x which is awesome for those wide scenic views.  The macro camera is very cool, and the phone supports GCam so you can get time lapse and photo spheres as well.  My only gripe is the stock apps but they were easy to remove.  Great value for the price, 4G working great on Lycamobile (Tmobile MVNO).

  Worth every penny. You can't expect the experience like samsung or Apple  from a 250 bucks phone. But at this price you won't be disappointed too. Although it is equipped with an IPS lcd display honestly i found it as equal to an amoled panels. Camera is fantastic needs some improvement though by software update. Battery life is tooooooo loooooong. Lasts for 3days of Moderate usage.Cons: speaker is like a joke. It sounds like a cheap Chinese radio.The most important thing i'd like to mention that xiaomi said now they have a new improved vibration motor for better haptic feedback but  on that one is worse than ever. . Even for more now they have removed the option to adjust vibration intensity  like soft , medium to hi tapping on the screen. So there is no way to adjust haptic feedback strength. All you have to stuck with default and it's seriously annoying.

  Overall, I am pleased with this phone, however, the description of it as an ""International version"" is not very precise. If you want to know exactly what version it is, the ""About phone"" menu says the MIUI version isVersion: V11.0.4.0.QJZEUXM (MIUI11)According to the c.mi.com, this makes the phone a Redmi Note 9 Pro EEA.

  I bought Xiaomi Redmi note 9 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 pro 2 phones, as a tablet, they are great, with large capacity batteries, fast processor is very comfortable to use. As a phone, completely unqualified. I USE T-Mobile network, I used to  have normal phone signals at home, but  this phone reception signal was very weak in my home .Many times I cannot make and receive calls at home. When the phone is connected, it is often intermittent. sometimes the call is automatically interrupted.  What I want is a phone, not a tablet.

  The phone is a very good value for the money and punches well above its price point, but in some ways, you get what you pay for.The good: Great battery life, large screen, good cameras, smooth UI, very quick.The bad: The screen could be better, it's slightly dark and the colors don't quite pop like on true flagship phones. By far the biggest issue though is the frequent wifi outages. Sometimes wifi shows connected, sometimes disconnected, but I can expect wifi to stop working every 30 minutes or so. It happens across all wifi networks, factory reset didn't fix it, updated miui didn't fix it either. If you don't have unlimited data, beware.

  I originally bought a xiaomi phone in January 2018 to replace my non-uogradeable Blu Pure XL. Xioami phone was light-years better. Unfortunately a shattered screen meant having to buy a new phone. I went with xiaomi Note 9 pro  global (US edition only it seems was available). It is a sad comparison to my old xiaomi. The one gesture I relied on most was the  native phone recording which made crystal clear  recordings of the conversation automatically. This feature is not available in the US version, apparently the is to Google and what I assume a  lobbying campaign to stifle their Chinese competition. Further evidence  to indicate this is that xiaomi phone users were left with Google.srticlrs to install Google's ""native"" call support which really only activates the sound recorder and catches only YOUR voice with a faint whisper  of the caller you can barely hear as the recorder is in the mouth piece and tries to hear the caller which is heard through the ear piece of the phone, the same failed recording option I had on my Blu Pure Xl. Also, the camera which hails as being better than my previous Xiaomi phone isn't. Save your money, just buy a comparable low end American phone.

  The Redmi Note 9 Pro was a decent phone in other respects (before I had to return it), but save your time trying to enable Wifi calling--the option is absent from the settings, where you'd find it on other Android phones.  I found a roundabout way to check that VoWifi was enabled, but apparently this is different from T-Mobile's Wifi Calling (at least in the U.S.?). The T-Mobile tech staff was unable to help. I've read that this phone's VoWifi works with some international carriers--Jio and AirTel.  Considering this is advertised as an unlocked, T-Mobile compatible phone, it should be made clear that Wifi calling through T-Mobile in the U.S. doesn't work.

  It's work alright, but don't meet my expectations. The screen kind of hurt my eye when i use it longer, And its too big! My finger can't control whole screen when i play Moba game. System is way more better than my old android phone, but it get stuck once in first 3 days.Update:After I Start Return. It Took 2 Weeks To Get Part Of Money Back . Around $50 Short From Original Price. Will Give 0 Star If I Can. The Screen Getting Bad And They Steal Your $50 For That, Terrible.

  I absolutely love this phone. Where do I start? It has specs which rival the flagship models of any brand out there, including the Samsung Note 20+ (although it has very little in common with the Note series - no stylus for one - so the name is misleading). 6 gigs of RAM, Octacore processor, a 64mb (!!!) quad lens camera that shoots beautiful, high resolution photos, 2 sim card slots, expandable memory via a MicroSD card slot, a huge, nearly bezel-less/infinity screen (not curved like the Note or S series but that didn't bother me, despite being a Samsung geek for the last ten years), and a HUGE 5000mAh battery (I can wake up with a full charge and wring this things neck all day - browsing the web, watching YouTube, watching a movie or 2 on Prime or Netflix, doing whatever else constitutes being ""glued to your phone all day""... By the time the day is through I will typically have 20-30% of battery life remaining whereas my Note8 (3000mAh) required being on the charger several times throughout. As expected due to the impressive specs the phone is extremely fast.. It reboots completely in seconds, there's no noticeable lag when opening / closing apps (including apps that tax the RAM and processor such as HD games, video players etc) as well as when multiple apps are running in the background.There aren't many cons and none are deal breakers, espec at this price, but it's worth mentioning that the phone is very heavy and the back is *somewhat* bulky. It's possible I've just been spoiled by the all glass construction of the later Samsung Note models, for all I know it's weight and bulk is consistent with the flagship models of most other brands. I only mention the weight and bulk *relative to the Note 8 I've been using for 3 years*.. After a week of using it I am not bothered by either.TL;DR - This is a powerful device that can go toe to toe with any other brand's flagship  for only $240. The camera, screen, and battery life are second to none. It's doubtful that you'll find it's equal for under $800, and it absolutely destroys anything in it's price point. But don't buy it because it's ""cheap"", buy it because it's a fantastic device and an incredible value.

  I'm very impressed with the phone so far, and here are some of the pros and cons.Pros:- very fast phone, it has a snapdragon 720g which is a very good chip for the price- good camera with portrait and night mode- super fast charger! This literally charges from 0 to 100% in under 30 minutes!- Huge battery, it can last for 2 days under moderate use- MIUI: it's one of the best Android skins out there- The fastest fingerprint reader on any phone- NFC: it's a handy feature if you wanna pay using your phoneCons:- Doesn't support many LTE frequencies used by carriers in the U.S, my T-Mobile 4G is stupid on this phone, plus it doesn't support wifi calling/messaging- LCD display: although the resolution is 1080p but the color accuracy on this display is mediocre, OLED is much better- Bloated: when I first started the phone, I was surprised by the number of apps that were pre installed, they took a lot of space, I ended up deleting most of them

I'm currently using the hotspot feature on Walmart phone just to write this review on my Xiaomi because the screen is bigger. In addition to bluetooth volume issues that only seem to get worse with time, that they have supplied no fix in an update for. I downloaded a volume booster app, because it solves an issue that Xiaomi is apparently incapable of solving.

  I am impressed with this phone, although I was happy with my Huawei Mate SE, I decided to give the Redmi Note 8 Pro a shot, and it does not disappoint. For the price, you can't beat it.Just popped in my sim card from straight talk, and it works like a champ. It does switch from LTE to regular 4G when on mobile data for a voice call. Other than that, no issues.The camera is excellent, considering I don't take many photos, but it gets the job done.You don't need to pony up in excess of $1, 000 for a phone.

  God, this is an amazing phone.  It was cheaper than my Moto G7 power by 20 bucks but there is really no comparison. I loved my G7 but this is next level on everything. Better screen,faster fingerprint reader, better camera and more cameras. Does everything seamlessly. Plus you get an IR blaster, and an update to android 10. The only thing I could say was better on the G7 was the battery life. The 8 pro still has great battery life almost equal to the G7, and don't believe anyone that reviews  it says it heats up, mine has stayed completely cool. I had a Xiaomi before, but this is a different ballgame. The other phone was a great phone too till I dropped it in the dog's water bowl. This one is water resistant, so hopefully if it happens again I won't have to buy a new phone. If you buy this phone you definitely won't be disappointed.

  Hasta el momento todo genial, la batería me dura 3 días con uso básico normal, la pantalla genial, carga las aplicaciones rápidamente, he jugado algunos juegos básicos y ha respondido perfectamente sin retrasos ni atorones, la cámara macro es FATAL, HORRIBLE, prácticamente es de adorno, salen muchísimo mejor las fotos con la cámara normal acercando el teléfono a lo que quieres fotografiar, los videos son buenos, pero con bastante ruido ya en la tarde aunque no sea noche, pero viniendo de un teléfono con algunos años de antigüedad, todo es una mejora en mi experiencia de uso.

  I purchased because friend recommendation but service interruptions, dropped calls and no service, makes the phone unusable.  It is an impressive piece of equipment but cannot live with that much problems.  I did asked Metro PCS if unit would work and was told, as long it is unlock, BS it does not work.  Providers have you control with individual service and make it impossible to connect properly.  Will purchase a phone from them, to avoid hassles.

  I’ve had this phone for 3 days now and that is good enough to provide an initial impression.In summary, this is a great piece of tech available at a very reasonable price.  But let me elaborate so that people reading this review can form their own opinionsFirst, I will talk about the looks and the build quality  It is great, the back in particular is so good looking and it reflects light differently at various angles.  Both front and back come with gorilla glass 5 so that should be durable, the front looks very clean and neat.  If I have to find a fault, the only one I can think of is that the side rim is made out of plastic, it is not metal.  First of all, it’s not easy to notice it. Secondly, it shouldn’t cause much concern since the phone still appears to be very sturdy and premium.  Overall, good build quality for the price.Screen quality and brightness  The screen is IPS LCD so obviously it doesn’t have the deep blacks like an AMOLED screen.  It doesn’t even have the kind of contrast that AMOLES has.  But, overall it is still a very high quality screen.  For comparison, I used iPhone XR which has an IPS LCD display and it matches or actually slightly beats it in my opinion.  Outdoor visibility is also very good because it has more than decent brightness.  So again, for the price, this is good.Software and Performance  It comes with a Android version 9 out of the box and it installs a security update immediately after booting up for the first time.  Yes Android 10 is out now and we should ideally have that.  Hopefully, we would get Android 10 on this phone soon through Mi UI new version.  But none of this takes away the software experience.  It is good, it is smooth and nice.  So far I haven’t experienced any slowness or lags.  It is doing a good job.  I installed poco installer which has been very helpful as it is better than Mi UI and has an app drawer which Mi UI doesn’t.Performance is also good, it comes with a dedicated game mode that you can use to bump up the performance while playing games.  Overall, very snappy and can play performance intensive games like subway surfers and asphalt easily.  People have complained it heats up. I have noticed even iPhones heating up when you play such games so it’s not really a concernCameras  It comes with 4 different cameras at the back with the primary one being 64 MP.  I haven’t used the cameras as much yet but have been able to try portrait mode, regular mode, 64 MP mode, wide angle mode and night time photography.  You can say that it is not at par with google or iPhone or Samsung phones but again for the price it is quite good.  Especially the wide angle camera has a nice field of view which allows it to take some great photos.  I just snapped a picture of 40 people standing in a group from up close using wide angle camera and it came out very nice.  For night time, the camera takes some time to take a snap as it is gathering as much light as possible to bring out a nice photo.  So overall it is very good. Happy with the pictures so far.  I have iPhone XS Max and it doesn’t have wide angle and night mode so getting those capabilities here has been good.  Also, the portrait mode is good and it produces good quality images with good blur effect and reasonably good edge detection.  Regarding the selfie camera, the performance  seemed ok, not great. It gives a bit of an artificial effect which is not preferred.  But that’s the only issue I have been able to find so farConnectivity to network  I have T-mobile and this phone works flawlessly on this network. Upload / download speed are very good.  On WiFi you it works very well.Battery and charging speedIt comes with a monster 4500 mAmp battery and damn it is good.  I have already reached screen on time of almost 6 hours and have more than 20% left.  I have done everything, played heavy games, watched a lot of YouTube videos, made phone calls, sent messages, browsed web.  You get an 18W charger in the box but I haven’t been able to use it as it’s not a North American charger.  I used another 27W charger that came with the Essential phone and charging speed is excellent.Other additions  There are a few other things that this phone brings in which possibly other phones don’t .  IR blaster, I used it and it works flawlessly on Samsung TVs.  It also has micro SD expansion slot which I intend to use very soon with fast storage and retrieval.  It comes with a case which is good and you don’t need to buy it separately before the phone arrives.And lastly it comes with a 3.5 mm headphone jack which is also great. Hardly any phones come ms with this now  a days.Overall very happy with the way this phone is shaping up, until nowPlease see some pictures of the phone for better insights

  I upgraded to this phone from a 4 year old mid level phone.  My biggest issue with that one was battery life, so that was a big consideration for me in my new device.  After doing a bunch of searching here on Amazon for an unlocked device, I found this one to have the best combination of cost to feature, after doing plenty of research on the processor.I've had the unit for a little over a month now, and I can say I am very pleased with the performance and battery life on this phone.  I am not a heavy user of my cell phone as my main media consumption device, and with my personal average use, a 100% charge will last me up to 3 days.  My previous phone was a daily charger.The size of the screen is great, even if it doesn't have the best brightness or contrast, for most people it's going to be good enough.  Same with the camera setup, while not absolutely the best thing ever, it is excellent and takes very clear shots.  The speaker is loud enough for normal use, and the other audio options (Bluetooth and Headphone Jack) have good output as well.  The interface is fast, and feels snappy under normal use.I am is the US on the AT&T network, and had no issues setting up the phone with the micro sim from my previous phone, and didn't have to do anything special to get the unit setup and working.  There is some bloatware on the phone that you can't remove, but you can ignore, which I would suggest.  I would recommend this device to anyone that doesn't 'need' a flagship or apple device.

  There was nothing good about this phone.The Android was completely modified to a point where you can no longer control your device. This phone is filled with bloatware that prevents you from doing centain things and you can't remove any of the bloatware apps, which you have to use.If you want to unlock or enable USB app installation because you are a developer then good luck. You will have to create an account with Xiaomi then register your sim card using your mobile data and have GPS on so they can find your home location. This sounds very sketchy and illegal. They're definitely something's going on with this phone manufacturer. Anytime you want to get the direct system log access it makes you go through bunch of hoops as if they are hiding something.If you are a long time Android user then stay away from Xiaomi phones. After 2019 they completely changed the whole Android OS system in to a black box that logs your activity.If you want to unlock your phone then good luck. Even with creating an account and going through all the steps you still won't be able to unlock your phone. And the worst part is the phone makes you wait 7 days every time you fail to try again. A lot has changed with this company to  point it is no longer the company you once know. I was able unlock OnePlus 3, 5T, 7T, Google pixel 2, Asus Zen Phone etc.. but not this phone.

  Everything checks out. The IMEI # is legit. Got here a full week before the arrival date unscratched and gorgeous. If you're from Puerto Rico and you're wondering if it works with Claro, it does. Provided you get the international version. This phone is utterly gorgeous. I love it. + No forced bloatware. Witch is awesome. The only bummer is that it came with the European charging brick. Not the U.S. one. But I honestly don't care that much about that last part since I have other charging bricks. The phone is great. Get it if you can .

  Wish I could give this zero stars.I was so excited upon receiving this phone as it's such a good deal and seemed really good quality.A few days after good use, the phone started malfunctioning. It started freezing, and then shutting itself off saying ""this device is corrupted.""And then turning itself back on and then freezing again and then repeating the process etc, over and over again.I'm so annoyed, now I won't have a phone for another week.Unfortunately, this phone is a piece of garbage.

  This cell phone is the best I have ever had in my life. I used to have Samsung cell phone before years ago so as other brand name phones I've got from T-Mobile and these worked exactly for a year and were not usable right when the warranty was expiring.I got tired of this and bought my first  off-brand cell phone - ZTE ZMAX - it was a great phone for 2015, much better than Samsung I had prior to it for the fraction of the cost! It worked for 2 years until the battery got fully discharged and I wasn't able to charge it ever again. I then bought Huawei Honor 6x and had it for 3 years. It worked just fine until it started acting with major delays, so I knew it was time to get a new phone.After multiple hours of research I decided to go with Remi Note 8. Thanks to ""frequency check"" site I knew I had to get a Global version. I highly recommend to check the phone model and your provider to see how many bands will be supported. I have T-Mobile and any International Version of this phone wasn't working for T-Mobile LTE.Unfortunately Amazon didn't have any Global versions of Redmi Note 8 in stock, so I wend with less memory and Redmi Not 8 Pro. It looks like I overpaid a little because overall prices were high (I blame coronavirus for that lol), but let me tell you - I didn't regret my decision even once because Redmi Note 8 Pro is AMAZING!It feels great - solid, nice, works smooth! I just love it.It takes great pictures. Not as great (real looking) as my Canon Mark II takes, but much better than other phones. Selfies are also great.  The connection is the same as I had with Honor 6x (which supported more LTE bands by the way). I experienced a lost of connection while driving on Interstate as well as in multiple story office building, but it didn't bother me as it happened few times really.The screen feels great to touch. The colors are amazing. Fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone works like a charm. Face recognition feature also works great. Fast browser. Battery life is also great, but my old Honor 6x was giving me full day of usage on one charge. I understand this phone is a huge upgrade from Honor 6x overall because it's been 3 years between these phones which is a huge time frame in technical world, but Redmi Note 9 Pro amazes me every day and I am not even using it to full capacity.I've got 64 gb one as the price difference for about $45 between this and 128 gb didn't do it for me. I am getting extra memory card which will last me for the duration of this phone's life. After all my old Honor 6x had 32 gb and 64 gm external card and I still was good on memory after 3 years on regular usage.My only doubt is the color. I've got it in forest green and it's beautiful, but I wanted it in white. Unfortunately the description for white didn't indicate it's a Global version so I wend with green. It still looks pretty cool! Included silicone cover is a bonus. My charger came without US adapter, so I ended up buying 2 for around $5 and now have capability of charging my phone super fast.If you still thinking of buying it... considering newer Redmi Note is about to be announced, don't waste time - this phone is pretty amazing! Hoping it will last for few years.

  Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don't really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile.The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I've never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi's MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven't tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.

  This phone is amazing for the price. The fingerprint reader is extremely snappy, scrolling is buttery smooth, and it's lightning fast. Not to mention it's a beautiful piece of tech. I got the green model. My service is with Cricket Wireless in rural Maryland and I'm getting all 5 bars of 4G LTE. I'm truly impressed by this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a $220 phone with $750 specs. I'm a happy camper.Update: After a few weeks using this phone I must say that it gets more amazing every day. I keep finding features while exploring the settings. I wasn't expecting an app drawer but in the settings there is an app drawer option. I'm still a happy camper.

  First Chinese phone other than a flagship Samsung and iPhone in over 6 years. couldn't be happier with this Redmi Note 8 Pro. Feels sleek in my hands, easy to navigate, not a ton of bloat ware, and battery lasts over 24 hours in between charges at least for the week I've had it.It's running Android 9.0 and has already received 1 system update which is nice moving forward. The camera is better than my old Samsung Galaxy 8 which is saying quite a bit.The DDR is 6gb which is less than the newest Galaxy 10 at 8gb, but this phone is blazing fast. Definitely gonna stick with xiachow for future phones

  I’ve had this phone for 3 days now and that is good enough to provide an initial impression.In summary, this is a great piece of tech available at a very reasonable price.  But let me elaborate so that people reading this review can form their own opinionsFirst, I will talk about the looks and the build quality  It is great, the back in particular is so good looking and it reflects light differently at various angles.  Both front and back come with gorilla glass 5 so that should be durable, the front looks very clean and neat.  If I have to find a fault, the only one I can think of is that the side rim is made out of plastic, it is not metal.  First of all, it’s not easy to notice it. Secondly, it shouldn’t cause much concern since the phone still appears to be very sturdy and premium.  Overall, good build quality for the price.Screen quality and brightness  The screen is IPS LCD so obviously it doesn’t have the deep blacks like an AMOLED screen.  It doesn’t even have the kind of contrast that AMOLES has.  But, overall it is still a very high quality screen.  For comparison, I used iPhone XR which has an IPS LCD display and it matches or actually slightly beats it in my opinion.  Outdoor visibility is also very good because it has more than decent brightness.  So again, for the price, this is good.Software and Performance  It comes with a Android version 9 out of the box and it installs a security update immediately after booting up for the first time.  Yes Android 10 is out now and we should ideally have that.  Hopefully, we would get Android 10 on this phone soon through Mi UI new version.  But none of this takes away the software experience.  It is good, it is smooth and nice.  So far I haven’t experienced any slowness or lags.  It is doing a good job.  I installed poco installer which has been very helpful as it is better than Mi UI and has an app drawer which Mi UI doesn’t.Performance is also good, it comes with a dedicated game mode that you can use to bump up the performance while playing games.  Overall, very snappy and can play performance intensive games like subway surfers and asphalt easily.  People have complained it heats up. I have noticed even iPhones heating up when you play such games so it’s not really a concernCameras  It comes with 4 different cameras at the back with the primary one being 64 MP.  I haven’t used the cameras as much yet but have been able to try portrait mode, regular mode, 64 MP mode, wide angle mode and night time photography.  You can say that it is not at par with google or iPhone or Samsung phones but again for the price it is quite good.  Especially the wide angle camera has a nice field of view which allows it to take some great photos.  I just snapped a picture of 40 people standing in a group from up close using wide angle camera and it came out very nice.  For night time, the camera takes some time to take a snap as it is gathering as much light as possible to bring out a nice photo.  So overall it is very good. Happy with the pictures so far.  I have iPhone XS Max and it doesn’t have wide angle and night mode so getting those capabilities here has been good.  Also, the portrait mode is good and it produces good quality images with good blur effect and reasonably good edge detection.  Regarding the selfie camera, the performance  seemed ok, not great. It gives a bit of an artificial effect which is not preferred.  But that’s the only issue I have been able to find so farConnectivity to network  I have T-mobile and this phone works flawlessly on this network. Upload / download speed are very good.  On WiFi you it works very well.Battery and charging speedIt comes with a monster 4500 mAmp battery and damn it is good.  I have already reached screen on time of almost 6 hours and have more than 20% left.  I have done everything, played heavy games, watched a lot of YouTube videos, made phone calls, sent messages, browsed web.  You get an 18W charger in the box but I haven’t been able to use it as it’s not a North American charger.  I used another 27W charger that came with the Essential phone and charging speed is excellent.Other additions  There are a few other things that this phone brings in which possibly other phones don’t .  IR blaster, I used it and it works flawlessly on Samsung TVs.  It also has micro SD expansion slot which I intend to use very soon with fast storage and retrieval.  It comes with a case which is good and you don’t need to buy it separately before the phone arrives.And lastly it comes with a 3.5 mm headphone jack which is also great. Hardly any phones come ms with this now  a days.Overall very happy with the way this phone is shaping up, until nowPlease see some pictures of the phone for better insights

  I upgraded to this phone from a 4 year old mid level phone.  My biggest issue with that one was battery life, so that was a big consideration for me in my new device.  After doing a bunch of searching here on Amazon for an unlocked device, I found this one to have the best combination of cost to feature, after doing plenty of research on the processor.I've had the unit for a little over a month now, and I can say I am very pleased with the performance and battery life on this phone.  I am not a heavy user of my cell phone as my main media consumption device, and with my personal average use, a 100% charge will last me up to 3 days.  My previous phone was a daily charger.The size of the screen is great, even if it doesn't have the best brightness or contrast, for most people it's going to be good enough.  Same with the camera setup, while not absolutely the best thing ever, it is excellent and takes very clear shots.  The speaker is loud enough for normal use, and the other audio options (Bluetooth and Headphone Jack) have good output as well.  The interface is fast, and feels snappy under normal use.I am is the US on the AT&T network, and had no issues setting up the phone with the micro sim from my previous phone, and didn't have to do anything special to get the unit setup and working.  There is some bloatware on the phone that you can't remove, but you can ignore, which I would suggest.  I would recommend this device to anyone that doesn't 'need' a flagship or apple device.

  There was nothing good about this phone.The Android was completely modified to a point where you can no longer control your device. This phone is filled with bloatware that prevents you from doing centain things and you can't remove any of the bloatware apps, which you have to use.If you want to unlock or enable USB app installation because you are a developer then good luck. You will have to create an account with Xiaomi then register your sim card using your mobile data and have GPS on so they can find your home location. This sounds very sketchy and illegal. They're definitely something's going on with this phone manufacturer. Anytime you want to get the direct system log access it makes you go through bunch of hoops as if they are hiding something.If you are a long time Android user then stay away from Xiaomi phones. After 2019 they completely changed the whole Android OS system in to a black box that logs your activity.If you want to unlock your phone then good luck. Even with creating an account and going through all the steps you still won't be able to unlock your phone. And the worst part is the phone makes you wait 7 days every time you fail to try again. A lot has changed with this company to  point it is no longer the company you once know. I was able unlock OnePlus 3, 5T, 7T, Google pixel 2, Asus Zen Phone etc.. but not this phone.

  Everything checks out. The IMEI # is legit. Got here a full week before the arrival date unscratched and gorgeous. If you're from Puerto Rico and you're wondering if it works with Claro, it does. Provided you get the international version. This phone is utterly gorgeous. I love it. + No forced bloatware. Witch is awesome. The only bummer is that it came with the European charging brick. Not the U.S. one. But I honestly don't care that much about that last part since I have other charging bricks. The phone is great. Get it if you can . The pics I posted i took with the camera of the phone.

  This phone is a beast! I cannot believe the price because I can match this up against my daughter's brand new Samsung feature for feature.Came beautifully packaged and ready to go right out of the box. I took the card out of my old phone and popped it in and it was ready to go.If you're on the fence do not hesitate. It is a beautiful phone and works like the most high-end brand.I love it!!!

  Wish I could give this zero stars.I was so excited upon receiving this phone as it's such a good deal and seemed really good quality.A few days after good use, the phone started malfunctioning. It started freezing, and then shutting itself off saying ""this device is corrupted.""And then turning itself back on and then freezing again and then repeating the process etc, over and over again.I'm so annoyed, now I won't have a phone for another week.Unfortunately, this phone is a piece of garbage.

  This cell phone is the best I have ever had in my life. I used to have Samsung cell phone before years ago so as other brand name phones I've got from T-Mobile and these worked exactly for a year and were not usable right when the warranty was expiring.I got tired of this and bought my first  off-brand cell phone - ZTE ZMAX - it was a great phone for 2015, much better than Samsung I had prior to it for the fraction of the cost! It worked for 2 years until the battery got fully discharged and I wasn't able to charge it ever again. I then bought Huawei Honor 6x and had it for 3 years. It worked just fine until it started acting with major delays, so I knew it was time to get a new phone.After multiple hours of research I decided to go with Remi Note 8. Thanks to ""frequency check"" site I knew I had to get a Global version. I highly recommend to check the phone model and your provider to see how many bands will be supported. I have T-Mobile and any International Version of this phone wasn't working for T-Mobile LTE.Unfortunately Amazon didn't have any Global versions of Redmi Note 8 in stock, so I wend with less memory and Redmi Not 8 Pro. It looks like I overpaid a little because overall prices were high (I blame coronavirus for that lol), but let me tell you - I didn't regret my decision even once because Redmi Note 8 Pro is AMAZING!It feels great - solid, nice, works smooth! I just love it.It takes great pictures. Not as great (real looking) as my Canon Mark II takes, but much better than other phones. Selfies are also great.  The connection is the same as I had with Honor 6x (which supported more LTE bands by the way).

  So I bought the phone because of the reviews and cost. It worked well for about 3 weeks then I noticed it started to freeze a lot and would go blank. Sometimes my apps won't load or they crash. I had replaced my Samsung Galaxy S8 for this thinking it would have been a better choice. But I'm very disappointed.

  *International version, Euro 5G only (for now)*The Nord N10 5G is a great budget minded phone, for $300. The SnapDragon 690 5G is a very capable processor and the Adreno 619L GPU is powerful enough to run the latest games and doesn't feel laggy (for games like COD Warzone etc etc) . Coming in with 6GB RAM (2GB less than the OnePlus flagships), 128GB storage and 90Hz refresh rate, the phone is snappy yet smooth as that 90Hz screen really makes a difference, giving you the feeling of a faster more premium hardware. For those on a budget, this phone is great! Just keep your expectations reasonable and  know what you are getting, as it is only Gorilla Glass 3 , not water resistant, and not as fast as say a Pixel 4A or OnePlus bigger flagship phones. It does come with some very cool features , using the Oxygen OS, such as RAM optimization and Game/ Fnatic mode where it will cut off use of all other apps while you game or watch movies, and directs all available resources to the apps you choose. Includes decent cameras (4 total) and a fingerprint read on the back (which I prefer). I have included the 3D Mark Benchmarks for Slingshot and Slingshot Extreme for those interested in raw power / numbers. Overall, this is a good deal and a great phone for those looking to save some money and also have a fast snappy phone capable of handling tougher applications and includes many features of better flagship phones. Enjoy!

  The phone is pretty good. The complaints I have are that it came with a warp charger that is not for the US, so I had to order one separately.

Both during the night, so my alarms didn't go off in the morning and both while the phone was fully charged.

All work very well.Supplier : delivery was on time as stated. Thank you for that.Sim 1 is 5G and sim2 is 4G (LTE)...

  Unfortunately had to return it because it was the international version and I use verizon. Other than that, THIS IS AN AMAZING BUDGET PHONE!!! My previous phone was the oneplus 6. The bad reviews are coming from people who had extremely high expectations that they get from higher end phones or accidentally bought the international version like myself. ONLY thing I would recommend to the seller is to make the product title a little bit clearer that this particular model is not compatible with CDMA carriers (Version, etc.). And yes I now have the US Version and that's what I'm basing my rating on, it's the same exact phone besides the CDMA thing!

  After using some of the best phones in the market switched to the 1+ NORD N10.

It does come with some very cool features , using the Oxygen OS, such as RAM optimization and Game/ Fnatic mode where it will cut off use of all other apps while you game or watch movies, and directs all available resources to the apps you choose. Includes decent cameras (4 total) and a fingerprint read on the back (which I prefer). I have included the 3D Mark Benchmarks for Slingshot and Slingshot Extreme for those interested in raw power / numbers. Overall, this is a good deal and a great phone for those looking to save some money and also have a fast snappy phone capable of handling tougher applications and includes many features of better flagship phones. Enjoy!

  The phone was really nice. I was excited to use it. But ended up returning it because I didn't want an international charger. I simply bought the US version a few weeks later.

  The phone is pretty good. The complaints I have are that it came with a warp charger that is not for the US, so I had to order one separately. The other issue is that the phone shuts off and needs to be forced started. I have had the phone two weeks and so far this has happened twice. Both during the night, so my alarms didn't go off in the morning and both while the phone was fully charged.

  This phone worked with T-Mobile 5G right out of the box  I love the fact the phone has a dual SIM card tray.

  Works very well with ATT, TMobile, AirTel, EE. Absolutely what I was looking for... No issue with transfer of all files from old phone... It worked like a charm. Fast charger works well (only slight inconvenience is: since it's a global version Charger needs a USA pin adapter... It's a bit wobbly... So I bought a US Version charger to fix that.  This global version Dual sim work very well with ATT and TMobile. I have had zero connections issues.I'd say excellent smart phone and bonus is price.I also use AirTel (India) sims when I travel to India and also EE Sim for UK travel... All work very well.Supplier : delivery was on time as stated. Thank you for that.Sim 1 is 5G and sim2 is 4G (LTE)... But since 5G currently has patchy service anyway... 4G is what I get mostly on both Sims. I have no problem with that.

  Unfortunately had to return it because it was the international version and I use verizon. Other than that, THIS IS AN AMAZING BUDGET PHONE!!! My previous phone was the oneplus 6. The bad reviews are coming from people who had extremely high expectations that they get from higher end phones or accidentally bought the international version like myself. ONLY thing I would recommend to the seller is to make the product title a little bit clearer that this particular model is not compatible with CDMA carriers (Version, etc.). And yes I now have the US Version and that's what I'm basing my rating on, it's the same exact phone besides the CDMA thing!

  After using some of the best phones in the market switched to the 1+ NORD N10. It can support 2 sims or one sim + micro SD card but not 2 sim card plus the micro sd card which  is not what i expected. Manufactures have switched to the hybrid Sim slots which is good for them but not for me.Camera is ok...pictures come blurry at times. Havent got a good one till now. (had the phone for less than 24 hors now).Its a good phone if you plan to use it for some browsing and calling. Needed a little time to understand the touch/swipe features.

  The progression and evolution of Samsung has not gone the way I would've foreseen it.  In the beginning when I first became a new fan, it was the Samsung S3.  I've owned the S3, LG G3, S6 Edge, S7 Edge, S8, Note 8, S9, Note 9, S10 Plus, Note 10 Plus, S20 Plus, Note 20 Ultra, and now the S21 Ultra.  What got me on Samsung?  I felt Samsung actually listened to consumers and gave us the room to help with development.  ""The next best thing"" It was a work in progress with every release and I felt like I was a part of it.  I was also not an Apple fan with the limited custom features and controls.  Fast forward to the S21 series.  There's a saying, you either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villain.  It appears the entire time, Samsung was the villain in the making.  We knew Samsung wanted to prove Apple wrong, but I didn't realize Samsung wanted to actually become Apple.  They mocked Apple only to follow Apple, what a bunch of hypocrites.  The peak of Samsung when I felt it was the people's company was the S10 plus.  The S10+ offered it all, the little FanBoy items that made me feel life was good with Samsung: headphone jack, heart rate sensor, MST/NFC mobile payment technology, great screen, thin bezel, in screen fingerprint scanner, included AKG headphones, fast charger, and expanded storage.  Do you remember?  Then the slow decline: the Note10 Plus released with no headphone jack and the loss of MST mobile pay.  Then the S20 Plus, no headphone jack, no MST, no heart rate sensor.  And now, the S21 Ultra with no headphone jack, no MST, no heart rate sensor, no headphones, no fast charger and no expandable storage.What have we gain with the S21 Ultra?  At a high cost, the screen is the best smartphone screen in the industry.  Barnone with its 120hz refresh rate and adaptive resolution.  The in-screen fingerprint scanner is upgraded, the camera is now among the best in a very crowded and competitive pool.After using the S21 Ultra for a few days, I was underwhelmed, coming from the S20 Plus.  I found myself missing the S20 Plus, and more the S10 Plus, even with the new upgrades.  I've lost enthusiasm and confidence in Samsung. The S21 Ultra's weight and size is not for me, I found myself with hand fatigue and not really enjoying using the S21 Ultra.  The SPen support is nice, but come on Samsung, this is a Galaxy S phone.  The Note 20 Ultra is actually the better phone than the S21 Ultra if you want productivity and comfort.There's no doubt the performance is noticeable particularly the high resolution and high refresh rate with the new Snapdragon 888, 12 gigs of memory and faster storage speeds.  But was it an advancement worth upgrading to...my 100% sure answer, definitive no.  There is a lacking of quality and value that I look for and want.  And in a way, Samsung I have a feeling knows that.  The pandemic and consumer behavior may have had something to do with it, but the S21 Ultra despite its advancements, left out too many great distinguishing Samsung features that defined a Samsung Galaxy S-series phone. The pre-order deal was so enticing to me, I jumped on it, with $700 of my old S20plus to trade up, and to also get $260 off of added buys - so I got the Buds Pro, S-pen, and a Samsung Case.  But I've decided to keep my S20 Plus and paying the difference.What I plan to do now is keep the S21 Ultra as a backup phone and continue to use my S20 Plus and Notw 20 Ultra.  Truth is I still have the S10 Plus and continue to be completely nostalgic about it -- putting my sim card in it from time to time reminiscing how it could've been instead of where we are now in the Samsung Galaxy S Line Up.Imagine the S21 Ultra having these features:  MTS/NFC payments, heart rate sensor, expandable storage, exceptional camera, best industry screen, IP68, Invictus protection, 120hz refresh rate with high resolution, 5000ma battery and everything else it has.That would be something amazing and exciting!!!If you still own the S10 Plus, keep it, if you own the S20 Plus, keep it.  The S21 Ultra, in my humble opinion is Samsung reducing itself to become the villain.  Don't start another lease agreement,  extend your contract, or get into another debt on the S21 Ultra.  It's harsh and it's my opinion.Rumor is we may not see the next Note this year, which disturbs me even more....stay tuned.  Samsung is trending toward Foldables, which I just don't get.

  I start saying “don’t pay attention to those 1-star reviews, which complain about no dual SIM support, no microSD, no charger, heaviness, etc."" We know the specs of what we're buying, if getting a microSD slot is paramount for some, they shouldn’t have bought the S21 in the first place.My experience with this phone has been excellent, having had almost every Galaxy S/Note iteration since 2010, S21 Ultra is no doubt the best smartphone Samsung has ever produced. Great high refresh QHD AMOLED display, solid built, powerful camera system with best-in-class zoom, improved fingerprint sensor, butter smooth interface, more-than-capable Snapdragon chipset, best battery life of any Galaxy S (one day with heavy use and two with light use). Yes, it is a heavy device but nowadays even midrange phones are weighting around 7 oz. Of course it’s not perfect but it’s close, low light photography could be better and should improve with software updates, speakers are just OK for a flagship, it ought to have faster charging capability (45W at least).That’s my summary, if you buy the S21 Ultra, you won’t be disappointed.

  If you're coming from an older galaxy device as I was from the s8+ this upgrade is a HUGE jump. I was hesitant at first due to the lack of SD card expansion and the removal of the iris scanner but really, I'm not missing my s8+ at all. The performance is just insane. Processor speed geekbench results are 2-4x the s8+. The display is absolutely gorgeous and the cameras are as well. She's a bit thick and heavy but not in a bad way. The phone feels great, solid in your hand. Very pleased with my decision to finally upgrade. I think the sweetspot may be 3-4 years in between upgrades as you really get A LOT out of it at that point. The differences generation to generation tend to be minimal.

  The s21 Ultra is best smartphone on the market, 1440p 120fps oled makes for a screen that looks so good with its high pixel density. blacks are super black, this screen goes really bright too in the sun. really smooth too. one of the best screens I've ever seen ever. newest 5nm snapdragon 888 processor makes it really fast and efficent. best main camera and telephoto camera ever. bettery life is ok, get like 6 hours sot with 1440p enabled depending how heavy you use your phone. just make sure to go throught the setting and change from fhd+ to qhd+ to get the sharpest display.only thing is its on the large side but doesn't feel that large because its taller than wider.don't get anything less than 256gb because there's no expandable storage.

  I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultras from this seller on a sale for a brand new phone.  It was too good to be true but only a few hundred off.  This phone was meant to be unlocked but T-Mobile and Samsung couldn't understand why it wasn't working.  Upon the boot up screen there was a clue that the software wasn't original. Really glad we didn't put in any banking information, not sure if there was malware or spyware.  Essentially the boot up screen said SAMSUNG GALAXY, only instead of S21 ULTRA which all my old Samsungs had the full title in the boot screen.  At the bottom it said Powered By Android in small letters and showed the little Android dude.  All other Samsungs I've had say Powered by Android is large white letters.Beware of scams at your cell provider's store as well.  They offered us a buy on e get one that wasn't an available deal.  Would have been stuck with either 2 non working phones with unofficial software or 2 full priced phones I couldn't cancel from the little store.  Do your homework on these large purchases.

  I upgraded from the Galaxy s8 to the S21 Ultra with 256 gb of storage and 12gb of ram. I will start off by saying go with the Ultra or the base, you pay $200 extra for half an inch of screen on the plus (this is called decoy price, you see this at movies where the popcorn medium is only 1 dollar less than the large, but is 3 more than the small, so you might as well go large.)I'll give more detial at the end.Camera is super high quality, zoom is incredible. Front camera even takes good pics (I mean I looked good, so should you)Processor is as advertised, insanely fast, even at the standard limited benchmark (there is an enhanced processing mode to take away cpu 70% limit). Desktop mode is great, this phone is almost as fast in Dex as my actual Acer laptop.Battery life is phenomenal, can get 2 full days out of 1 charge if you use the phone less than 4 or 5 hours a day at 1080p res.1440p, super clear and one of the bargaining point for the Ultra over the base. The refresh rate of 120 hz is incredible, I spent the first 10 minutes just swiping on the phone in awe of this. The ultra is also the only version with the curved screen,, the s21 and plus have flat screens.. This phone does an excellent job of cooling, even witha case on. (FYI heat causes the major wear and tear on the internal components like the cpu, so better cooling means better lifespan and performance).Customizable routines allow you to add features to your phone, from automatically silencing when you show up to work or school, automatically going into power save mode at certain times like when you are asleep, or even for when you turn on your Bluetooth headphones your phone can automatically switch to 1440p resolution and turn Dolby atmos on movie mode sound. Dozens of scenarios or time stamps for each feature.If you are the friend that walks on the grass, don't worry about bringing that bulky charger for when your friends' phones are about to die, this phone can wireless charge other devices (will stop charging when the phone drops to 30% minimum).If you are concerned about no color options, just remember, I had that beautiful orchid gray s8, and who got to see it? Nobody, because it was hidden behind a lovely teal case for 4 years.If the fact that Samsung dropped their charging from the 45w of the s20 series to a 25w for the s21, rest assured, there is very little added time for charging, and the 25w is less volatile than the 45w. This means, charging does not get the phone as hot, and the battery will have a better lifespan since slower charging is better long term.If you multi task a ton and/or save tons of files, consider spending the extra money to get the 512 gb edition, as it comes with an additional 4gb of ram (16gb total).Ram is what is used to have tabs open, so more ram means more tabs open while still maintaining speed and smoothness. The s21 ultra also has Spen support (need a case that can hold it).Why the ultra or base and not the plus?The s21 has a better ppi (pixel density, higher the density, better the picture) than the s21 plus. They both have the same 8gb of ram, the same storage sizes, same resolution, same cameras, same material, same flat screen, the same backwards wireless charging capability (same for ultra), etc. The only difference is the screen size and that the s21 plus has a 4800 mAh battery while the s21 has a 4000 mAh. The ultra however, offers higher resolution, much higher ppi, the larger screen, larger battery than both (5000mAh). The ultra has much more powerful camera as well, the curved screen, camera features and settings. So if you want all the features and performance and screen resolution (I like the stream movies  on my lunch breaks) then go with the Ultra, if you just want to upgrade to the newest and fastest phone, and you don't need to have 100000 tabs open, get the base s21.

  1. Phone.  Let's not forget it's initial purpose of existence... communication.  I think it's a Verizon thing, but the sound quality of phone calls is uniquely satisfying and clear.2. Signal.  For carrier signal,  for me,  it is much better than my previous 4G device,  the Galaxy S8+. I cannot mention much about the 5G signal nor it's data speeds as the network is still fairly limited in my area.  Wifi is dramatically improved.  Bluetooth,  NFC, GPS, Wifi Hotspot,  and Wifi Direct seem extremely responsive and equally great.3. Performance.  This thing is a power house.  With the dual quad core CPU's, Snapdragon 888 SOC, Qualcomm Adreno 660 GPU, 120 Hz AMOLED display,  everything is snappy and quick.4. Battery.  5000 mAh ought to seem like a lot,  and it is.. Though with the performing hardware mentioned above,  don't expect a solid week's worth of gaming in a device of this caliber.  Power saving features exist for a reason.  Changing your display output to 720, enabling an aggressive power saving mode,  setting your screen brightness to the lowest value,  and limiting yourself to calls only,  you can get several days of use on a single charge.  Without those energy saving measures, expect about half to a full day's use on a single charge.5. Charging.  It lacks a 25 watt super fast charger,  or any charger at all.  It does come with a USC type C to type C cable though.  You get five varying levels of charging:  two with wireless,  three wired.  For wireless,  standard and fast charging.  Wired, standard,  fast,  and super fast.  With super fast,  it can fully charge a dead device in about an hour.  The slowest charge is around three hours.  For longevity,  don't super charge unless absolutely necessary.6. Camera(s). 12,000 x 9,000 pixels is a lot of depth. About 35 MB per photo at 108 megapixels.  There are Pro modes for video and stills as well.  8k at 24fps? I don't get that one.  But a solid 60fps for 4k video is outstanding.  Add the stability feature and you're now a video director and professional cameraman. The video and photos are beyond excellent. The 100x zoom is a comedic gimmick.  Let's get that out there.  The HDR low light photos are superior to any device I have used.  The video has no HDR capture support ):  . Shame.  The macro support is fantastic.  Crisp,  clear images in just about every shot.7. Storage.  This one is tough.  Samsung recently ditched expandable memory,  which really upset me initially.  It's a selling point.  If you intend to use lots of apps,  take lots of photos,  videos,  download oodles of stuff... choose wisely.  If you don't have a computer or infrequently dump your device data to a cloud service or another PC, get more storage.  I settled for the middle ground at 256 GB. After my apps are setup and good to go,  I have about 190 GB of usable storage remaining. Plenty... for now.8. OS. I could sit here and talk about Android 11 and Samsungs TouchWiz UI, but it won't matter.  Software gets updated now frequently than hardware,  and will forever change.  The software on this device is only slightly different from similar devices.  It's much better than previous revisions.  Both Samsung and Android allow for some more aggressive customizations on newer devices. It's nice,  to say the least.9. Features.  Power sharing is nice,  but with its beastly hardware,  you'll likely not want to share your precious battery with anyone,  nor anything else.  It's a neat,  almost useless feature to me. DEX by Samsung is still an infant.  Don't even mess with it.  Link to Windows is cool,  but needs some fine tuning to be better.  You still have a flashlight. That's cool.  The fingerprint reader is neat,  but tricky to learn since it's behind the main display.  It takes a while to get used to.  I wish we could add more than four fingerprints,  or allow more passes for each finger.  It isn't always consistent in every condition.  This phone supports the S-pen and select S-view cases as well.  They're not included,  and are fairly pricey accessories.10. Design. When LG started advertising the Chocolate with Christina Aguilera singing in the background,  I knew phones were competing with cars for our attention in ads.  The corners,  surfaces,  feels,  looks,  sharpness,  and radiant elegance is near perfection.  Dat camera bump,  though.... I almost wish they made a thicker battery,  maybe 8, 000 to 10,000 mAh, to craft a better balance and prevent the offsetting camera bump from existence.  Why does the edge panel have a bubble leveler for this device?  You can't use it! That's just silly.  The camera pimple...I don't like it.  YouTube is the only platform to support HDR10 for a device like this,  and it looks beautiful.  Super bright.  Super sharp.  Super..darn... that pimple is quite noticeable and slightly breaks immersion. This phone weighs less than my previous Galaxy S8+. It's only slightly larger as well.  That's impressive to me.Is it worth a grand?  Considering the fact that I paid as much as I did for my S8+? Yes.  It's a considerable upgrade.  I highly recommend a case.  Especially one that can add balance as to rid itself of the camera bump.  A screen protector is also recommended,  as with any device with such a large display.  I don't care that it has the latest Corning Gorilla Glass on it.  Micro scratches are a thing. And with a display like this,  you will want to preserve its perfections,  even if it has an adolescent pimple on one end.

The refresh rate of 120 hz is incredible, I spent the first 10 minutes just swiping on the phone in awe of this. The ultra is also the only version with the curved screen,, the s21 and plus have flat screens.. This phone does an excellent job of cooling, even witha case on. (FYI heat causes the major wear and tear on the internal components like the cpu, so better cooling means better lifespan and performance).Customizable routines allow you to add features to your phone, from automatically silencing when you show up to work or school, automatically going into power save mode at certain times like when you are asleep, or even for when you turn on your Bluetooth headphones your phone can automatically switch to 1440p resolution and turn Dolby atmos on movie mode sound. Dozens of scenarios or time stamps for each feature.If you are the friend that walks on the grass, don't worry about bringing that bulky charger for when your friends' phones are about to die, this phone can wireless charge other devices (will stop charging when the phone drops to 30% minimum).If you are concerned about no color options, just remember, I had that beautiful orchid gray s8, and who got to see it? Nobody, because it was hidden behind a lovely teal case for 4 years.If the fact that Samsung dropped their charging from the 45w of the s20 series to a 25w for the s21, rest assured, there is very little added time for charging, and the 25w is less volatile than the 45w. This means, charging does not get the phone as hot, and the battery will have a better lifespan since slower charging is better long term.If you multi task a ton and/or save tons of files, consider spending the extra money to get the 512 gb edition, as it comes with an additional 4gb of ram (16gb total).Ram is what is used to have tabs open, so more ram means more tabs open while still maintaining speed and smoothness. The s21 ultra also has Spen support (need a case that can hold it).Why the ultra or base and not the plus?The s21 has a better ppi (pixel density, higher the density, better the picture) than the s21 plus. They both have the same 8gb of ram, the same storage sizes, same resolution, same cameras, same material, same flat screen, the same backwards wireless charging capability (same for ultra), etc. The only difference is the screen size and that the s21 plus has a 4800 mAh battery while the s21 has a 4000 mAh. The ultra however, offers higher resolution, much higher ppi, the larger screen, larger battery than both (5000mAh). The ultra has much more powerful camera as well, the curved screen, camera features and settings. So if you want all the features and performance and screen resolution (I like the stream movies  on my lunch breaks) then go with the Ultra, if you just want to upgrade to the newest and fastest phone, and you don't need to have 100000 tabs open, get the base s21.

  1. Phone.  Let's not forget it's initial purpose of existence... communication.  I think it's a Verizon thing, but the sound quality of phone calls is uniquely satisfying and clear.2. Signal.  For carrier signal,  for me,  it is much better than my previous 4G device,  the Galaxy S8+. I cannot mention much about the 5G signal nor it's data speeds as the network is still fairly limited in my area.  Wifi is dramatically improved.  Bluetooth,  NFC, GPS, Wifi Hotspot,  and Wifi Direct seem extremely responsive and equally great.3. Performance.  This thing is a power house.  With the dual quad core CPU's, Snapdragon 888 SOC, Qualcomm Adreno 660 GPU, 120 Hz AMOLED display,  everything is snappy and quick.4. Battery.  5000 mAh ought to seem like a lot,  and it is.. Though with the performing hardware mentioned above,  don't expect a solid week's worth of gaming in a device of this caliber.  Power saving features exist for a reason.  Changing your display output to 720, enabling an aggressive power saving mode,  setting your screen brightness to the lowest value,  and limiting yourself to calls only,  you can get several days of use on a single charge.  Without those energy saving measures, expect about half to a full day's use on a single charge.5. Charging.  It lacks a 25 watt super fast charger,  or any charger at all.  It does come with a USC type C to type C cable though.  You get five varying levels of charging:  two with wireless,  three wired.  For wireless,  standard and fast charging.  Wired, standard,  fast,  and super fast.  With super fast,  it can fully charge a dead device in about an hour.  The slowest charge is around three hours.  For longevity,  don't super charge unless absolutely necessary.6. Camera(s). 12,000 x 9,000 pixels is a lot of depth. About 35 MB per photo at 108 megapixels.  There are Pro modes for video and stills as well.  8k at 24fps? I don't get that one.  But a solid 60fps for 4k video is outstanding.  Add the stability feature and you're now a video director and professional cameraman. The video and photos are beyond excellent. The 100x zoom is a comedic gimmick.  Let's get that out there.  The HDR low light photos are superior to any device I have used.  The video has no HDR capture support ):  . Shame.  The macro support is fantastic.  Crisp,  clear images in just about every shot.7. Storage.  This one is tough.  Samsung recently ditched expandable memory,  which really upset me initially.  It's a selling point.  If you intend to use lots of apps,  take lots of photos,  videos,  download oodles of stuff... choose wisely.  If you don't have a computer or infrequently dump your device data to a cloud service or another PC, get more storage.  I settled for the middle ground at 256 GB. After my apps are setup and good to go,  I have about 190 GB of usable storage remaining. Plenty... for now.8. OS. I could sit here and talk about Android 11 and Samsungs TouchWiz UI, but it won't matter.  Software gets updated now frequently than hardware,  and will forever change.  The software on this device is only slightly different from similar devices.  It's much better than previous revisions.  Both Samsung and Android allow for some more aggressive customizations on newer devices. It's nice,  to say the least.9. Features.  Power sharing is nice,  but with its beastly hardware,  you'll likely not want to share your precious battery with anyone,  nor anything else.  It's a neat,  almost useless feature to me. DEX by Samsung is still an infant.  Don't even mess with it.  Link to Windows is cool,  but needs some fine tuning to be better.  You still have a flashlight. That's cool.  The fingerprint reader is neat,  but tricky to learn since it's behind the main display.  It takes a while to get used to.  I wish we could add more than four fingerprints,  or allow more passes for each finger.  It isn't always consistent in every condition.  This phone supports the S-pen and select S-view cases as well.  They're not included,  and are fairly pricey accessories.10. Design. When LG started advertising the Chocolate with Christina Aguilera singing in the background,  I knew phones were competing with cars for our attention in ads.  The corners,  surfaces,  feels,  looks,  sharpness,  and radiant elegance is near perfection.  Dat camera bump,  though.... I almost wish they made a thicker battery,  maybe 8, 000 to 10,000 mAh, to craft a better balance and prevent the offsetting camera bump from existence.  Why does the edge panel have a bubble leveler for this device?  You can't use it! That's just silly.  The camera pimple...I don't like it.  YouTube is the only platform to support HDR10 for a device like this,  and it looks beautiful.  Super bright.  Super sharp.  Super..darn... that pimple is quite noticeable and slightly breaks immersion. This phone weighs less than my previous Galaxy S8+. It's only slightly larger as well.  That's impressive to me.Is it worth a grand?  Considering the fact that I paid as much as I did for my S8+? Yes.  It's a considerable upgrade.  I highly recommend a case.  Especially one that can add balance as to rid itself of the camera bump.  A screen protector is also recommended,  as with any device with such a large display.  I don't care that it has the latest Corning Gorilla Glass on it.  Micro scratches are a thing. And with a display like this,  you will want to preserve its perfections,  even if it has an adolescent pimple on one end.

  Update 8/31/20 IF YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE YOUR WIRED AKG headphones, it's because Samsung decided not to add it to the box for US customers.Call Samsung USA at (800) 726-7864 to request yours for free, it's a bit of a hassle, but they sent mine at the end. You haven't been scammed if you don't find the wired headphones  in the box!Original review: I say it's the best, with a grain of salt, read the cons to know why!To start off, Samsung did an amazing job with this phone, so much that they rendered the fairly new, still very expensive, S20 Ultra, almost obsolete!But I'm not gonna review both units here, so for those of you looking for quick pros & cons, here you go.Pros:- AMAZING display, I had so many high end phones, including the IPhone 11 pro max and Google Pixel 4XL & even the note 10, but this screen here bests all of them. The high refresh rate, the beautiful colors, and the better ratio (it's a little wider than the S20 ultra for example), all this makes for an outstanding screen.- Great main camera. The pictures are just perfect in almost all light conditions. I dunno how much better is the 108 MP mode, it bothered me a little that cropping a 108 MP picture didn't yield the perfect result, but all in all, the camera is top notch, in all its modes. The videos are even better. You won't find a phone with a better main camera on the market.- The S pen is pretty useful for taking notes! I didn't feel like I needed it for anything else except, may be, for a selfie, so eventhough it isn't the biggest selling point, it's worth mentioning.- It looks great! Yup, design wise, that phone looks really good, that it feels bad putting any covers on it. I personally just ordered a very slim, transparent case & I wouldn't recommend anything else.There are some added gimmicky features that you can find almost everywhere online, but I personally loved the direct share, where I can show anything I want from my phone and cast it to a smart TV or one with a Google chrome cast attached to it, it happened a lot before that I needed to show many people at the same time, whatever it is that was on my phone, photos or a certain app, and that feature here makes it so easy.Cons:- I dunno how this isn't mentioned anywhere, but the selfie camera isn't great at all in low light conditions. Yes in the morning, outdoor, it is very good, but other than that it's just not great! I could see myself buying the next Google Pixel instead, just for this.- Battery life isn't good enough either. It's worse than my S20 Ultra, and it was no surprise, since Samsung decided to give this phone a smaller battery 🙄I find myself charging it twice a day, which really isn't practical.Just for those 2 points, added to the fact that it's a super expensive phone, I had to give it 4 stars.Now if it gets the Google Pixel software for the selfie camera, and a full day of battery life that would have been the best phone ever made! But I guess we'll have to wait for next year for that!

   I got this on launch day and it had a defect where the S pen wasn't registering in a large circular area on the screen. Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I'm done with it. I've had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.

  The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.I would definitely recommend a solid case if you're planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).Other thoughts: I think it's interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can't say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it's important enough to you. For me it is, and I'm very happy with this phone.Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone's specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you're somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, & screen quality that money can buy you right now.

  I purchased the 128GB with 4GB ram model in all black.  My wife's S8+ that was close to becoming non-functional and I needed a new phone asap.  I had previously purchased an A20s for my son and so I first ordered the A30s until I did some research regarding my mobile provider T-Mobile in the US.I cancelled the A30s and got the A51 primarily because of the supported LTE bands. T-Mobile uses the following bands2, 4, 5, 12, 66, 71The A30s only supports band 5 from the that list!However, the A51 supports band 2, 4, 5, 12 and 66.  I was gladly willing to pay a little more to ensure I had maximum connectivity with my carrier so I cancelled the A30s and purchased the A51 instead.Now with that primary consideration out of the way, on to the rest of the review.  I'll start with the best parts first.1.  Call quality, reception and connectivityThe call quality is excellent on this phone, right up there with my s10+.  I think the microphone quality has been improved because my wife loves using the speakerphone and on her hold s8+, her voice occasionally cut out here and there as the mic tried to pick up her voice.  Also, the sound quality of the voice has improved as well which further helps to understand the conversation.  Reception has been about the same compared to my s10+, which is to say pretty good.  We measured on signel strength and asu.  The mobile data speeds are excellent even in areas that are typically weaker in signal strength.2.  ScreenSamsung AMOLEDs are the best in the business when it comes to screen quality.  We are a little relieved the screen is not curved because this allows us to get a robust case to protect everything.  The colors, quality and resolution are all indistuingishable compared to my s10+.  The front camera is a tiny pinhole so the entire body is pretty much all screen.  There is an in-screen fingerprint reader which is optical, rather than infrasonic on my s10+ but it is still reasonably fast to unlock the phone.  Yes it is slightly slower than my s10+ but we're talking milliseconds of difference.3.  General usabilityMy wife is not a gamer so I can't say anything about the gaming experience but she does use a ton of media and productivity apps.  For all of her use on them so far, she says they feel snappy.  They all open fast and transition well and she multitasks as much as before without a shred of difference.  When we first setup the phone, we were concerned because there was some UI lag but realized a lot of processing was being used during the Samsung Switch, which transfered her entire old phone to the new phone.  Once the switch was done, we rebooted and the phone was responsive and fast.4.  CameraThe camera hardware has some beefy specs.  But for a mostly point-and-shooter, it's hard to really go wrong many camera setups.  Picture quality looks great in the light and not as good in the dark compared to my s10+.  The slower camera speed is noticeable, transitioning between the main camera/wide/macro takes about a half second, where on my s10+ is pretty much instant.  The shutter is just as fast, luckily.  If camera speeds are important to you, you would probably not be happy with this phone.5.  BatteryI have to admit, we were looking forward to getting more usable time out of the battery.  The battery is 4000mah unit and the s8+ was only 3500mah.  However, through the typical daily use, we found that the end-of-day percentage left were about the same.  We average about 4 hours of on-screen time scattered throughout the day with app use and web-browsing and the battery was around 40% left, which is the same as the s8+.  If long battery life is important to you, you would not be happy with this phone but keep in mind, it can easily last an entire busy day on a single charge.Overall, we like the phone for the price of under $300.

  I researched this exact model and every website says that this model comes with NFC, but it doesn't.

This phone is an international phone and it has some things in the settings that are in Spanish when I chose ""English"" in the setup. This phone also came with Android Auto preinstalled, but there is no way to open the app. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help either. Not pleased that this phone doesn't have NFC and the fact it has software bugs and it cost me $300 before tax. There are other phones out there for a lower price and even better specs. Not sure if will buy another Samsung phone after this experience.

  After learning about the A51 differences I would like to say that model SM-A515F/DS has 128GB internal storage, 4GB of RAM and doesn't have NFC setting. Model SM-A515F/DSN has 128GB internal storage, 6GB of RAM and has the NFC setting.I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A51 Prism Crush Black phone April 27, 2020 and two days later the phone was at my doorstep (just the phone). The box came in completely sealed and it had all the accessories. After going through all the configuration (I did not setup fingerprint or face recognition at the beginning) I was in business. The colors on the Samsung Galaxy A51 are amazing. I did make a change under Settings > Display > Screen Mode, from Natural to Vivid and turn on Dark Mode. The fingerprint is under Settings > Biometrics and Security > Fingerprints. It took me a while to be able to setup fingerprint. Honestly did it like 30 times until it read 100%. You will have to move the finger to different angles until it reads your fingerprint completely. Every time it reads new lines the percentage goes higher. Once I was done, I tested it and it worked fine. I used all other 9 fingers different angles to see if it would let me login, and it DID NOT. The phone does take great pictures. I tested the macro on one of my dogs nose and WOW, the pic was stunning. The pic of a lizard was taken in macro. Calls are clear and it shows LTE with strong signal.  I am registered with MetroPCS and my dad with AT&T. I used my dad's AT&T sim card and it worked (picture shows Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T).The phone does have 4GB of RAM. When I purchased mine the price had drop to the point I couldn't pass it. I didn't see anything on Amazon page at that time, but I don't care, I'm very happy with the phone.Aside from the A51, I purchased a Feitenn Samsung Galaxy A51 Metal Case (ASIN B0839C38GM). The case is sturdy and it DOES protect the phone. The screen protector IS NOT attached (together) to the metal case like it shows on the pictures, and the screen protector IS NOT gorilla glass, it is just regular and it doesn't have the whole for the front camera. I placed an order for 3 Tempered Glass (ASIN B082S7NCB8).Thanks

  Happy to receive the phone a day early, the finger print censor isn't as good as it could be but the face recognition is amazing especially on a lower end phone. The last Samsung I had was a galaxy note 8, I have tried other android phones from Motorola to lg and nothing can compare to a samsung. I haven't had the phone long will update in a month. But so far happy with the phone. I use cricket as my carrier and was able to put my sim card in and it read it right away. I'm getting decent service on the phone better than what I did with my previous phone. I like how light the phone feels, it also fits well in my hands for texting and calling. I don't need all the high end bells and whistles so the phone does everything I need for It is an amazing budget phone.

  This is a really nice phone, after 3 month I'm finally writing a review and all I can say that this phone is worth it. It come with an extra case as well and the back looks spectacular with the rainbow reflection. Another amazing thing about the phone is the responsiveness because it is quite quick and it handles everything you throw at it. The camera quality is really good, finger print works good, face id is quick, the display looks very good, and overall I would recommend this phone to anyone.

Model SM-A515F/DSN has 128GB internal storage, 6GB of RAM and has the NFC setting.I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A51 Prism Crush Black phone April 27, 2020 and two days later the phone was at my doorstep (just the phone). The box came in completely sealed and it had all the accessories. After going through all the configuration (I did not setup fingerprint or face recognition at the beginning) I was in business. The colors on the Samsung Galaxy A51 are amazing. I did make a change under Settings > Display > Screen Mode, from Natural to Vivid and turn on Dark Mode. The fingerprint is under Settings > Biometrics and Security > Fingerprints. It took me a while to be able to setup fingerprint. Honestly did it like 30 times until it read 100%. You will have to move the finger to different angles until it reads your fingerprint completely. Every time it reads new lines the percentage goes higher. Once I was done, I tested it and it worked fine. I used all other 9 fingers different angles to see if it would let me login, and it DID NOT. The phone does take great pictures. I tested the macro on one of my dogs nose and WOW, the pic was stunning. The pic of a lizard was taken in macro. Calls are clear and it shows LTE with strong signal.  I am registered with MetroPCS and my dad with AT&T. I used my dad's AT&T sim card and it worked (picture shows Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T).The phone does have 4GB of RAM. When I purchased mine the price had drop to the point I couldn't pass it. I didn't see anything on Amazon page at that time, but I don't care, I'm very happy with the phone.Aside from the A51, I purchased a Feitenn Samsung Galaxy A51 Metal Case (ASIN B0839C38GM). The case is sturdy and it DOES protect the phone. The screen protector IS NOT attached (together) to the metal case like it shows on the pictures, and the screen protector IS NOT gorilla glass, it is just regular and it doesn't have the whole for the front camera. I placed an order for 3 Tempered Glass (ASIN B082S7NCB8).Thanks

  Got the phone, 4 gig ram, might not be a such thing as 6 gig . Every online seller seems to be the same few people amazon or not, it will work , camera is great but most carriers wont see the iemi and you most likely will get something like h+ . As much as i dont want to, i will have to return the phone . Samsung and att couldnt help me . I will try the us unlock a50

  Happy to receive the phone a day early, the finger print censor isn't as good as it could be but the face recognition is amazing especially on a lower end phone. The last Samsung I had was a galaxy note 8, I have tried other android phones from Motorola to lg and nothing can compare to a samsung. I haven't had the phone long will update in a month. But so far happy with the phone. I use cricket as my carrier and was able to put my sim card in and it read it right away. I'm getting decent service on the phone better than what I did with my previous phone. I like how light the phone feels, it also fits well in my hands for texting and calling. I don't need all the high end bells and whistles so the phone does everything I need for It is an amazing budget phone.

  This is a really nice phone, after 3 month I'm finally writing a review and all I can say that this phone is worth it. It come with an extra case as well and the back looks spectacular with the rainbow reflection. Another amazing thing about the phone is the responsiveness because it is quite quick and it handles everything you throw at it. The camera quality is really good, finger print works good, face id is quick, the display looks very good, and overall I would recommend this phone to anyone.

  After having Samsung and LG phones for the past 10+ years, I took a chance with the Redmi 9. What a fantastic phone this has been. And, for a fraction of the cost. I will admit, my Samsung S9 was a great phone and did perform slightly faster. However for the price point, it's not even an issue. The battery life on this phone surpasses that of the S9 by a long shot. The dual SIM feature allows me to have one phone with two numbers, eliminating my seconds cell phone for business. All in all, this phone is a true winner and I will continue with this brand.

  I had the note 7, note 8 Pro and I just purchased the 9 dual SIM for my son. These phones are absolutely unbeatable at twice the price. Very durable, great processors, nice screen, face recognition is flawless.

  Cons:The MIUI is the most obnoxious UI I have ever used. It's just not as clean feeling as stock android or other phones I've used.There is no option in the boot loader to wipe cache partition. So if your phone starts acting up your only option is to reinstall the OS.The phone dialer has asian characters on it. Replaced with stock android phone/text/contacts apps.Text messaging has constant nag screens to use their Xioami cloud service. Fixed with replacing with stock android apps.I kept getting popups to activate the sim card even though the phone was already working with my provider. It was fixed by disabling notifications for that app.The fingerprint reader is....awkward. It works. But it just isn't very responsive. The one on my Huawei phone was flawless.The wifi takes a minute to connect. Once connected it's fine. Again, my Huawei phone was instantaneous. It would connect to the wifi immediately.Pros:Excellent battery life.Runs fast enough for what I use it for.Very bright screen.Other:The phone gets better reception in some areas and worse in others than my old Huawei phone. So I guess it's kind of a wash. Neither positive nor negative.Probably going to root this thing and install stock android at some point. The UI really is miserable.

  I have been using my new phone for nearly two months now. I am very happy with it! The phone came with the US standard charger as well as a clear phone case and screen protection layer is already on! I charge the battery about every 3-4 days. I am not a heavy phone user. This phone suits my needs in every way!!

  This phone was awesome. It had a beautiful display, it was fast, photos were beautiful the phone did not feel like the price. It felt high quality.It was 4g LTE with voLTE. Unfortunately cricket stated they don't support xiaomi phones. The phone service however worked and I made phone calls with no issue and text messages. I will definitely be looking into xiaomi as a top brand. I'm coming from iPhones and Samsung models.
