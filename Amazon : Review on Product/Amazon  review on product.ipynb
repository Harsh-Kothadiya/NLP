Still love it!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  From a loyal LG customer, last was the LG V30 with amazing sound, video and camera quality.  But the ram, memory and battery life started lacking.  The Note 9 Pro beats it in spades.  Battery life is the best part of the phone.  I\\'ve had used it 3 days straight with mobile data constantly on before recharging.  Never spent more than $300 on a phone as I always buy one or two generations behind.But it\\'s not without its quirks.  And it may be unfair to compare it to the 3 year old LG V30.Firstly it\\'s a Chinese phone so there may be a security risk.  Lately I\\'ve had emails from Venmo about unauthorized sign-ins since using the phone.  But that could be another data breach.Secondly, the UI is very basic.  MIUI on android 10 is not very customizable.  From a 3 year old Flagship LG V30 the Note 9 Pro is lacking.  Can\\'t control game graphics and frame rate like the V30 running on android 9.  But it\\'s moot since the battery is so big.  One cool feature is running 2 apps in split screen top/bottom and 50/50 or 66/33 or 33/66 size.  The V30 was able to do that.  But you can drag an app out and have it float on a corner as a window.  Also can\\'t change the aspect ratio or the resolution of the screenThirdly, even though it\\'s unlocked you have to make sure your carrier bands are supported.  I\\'m with T-Mobile and most bands are supported but still had to create a custom APN (look it up) to send/receive txts and mms txts.  The APN on my sim card was not fully compatible.  Also if I don\\'t keep mobile data on there\\'s no guarantee of incoming/outgoing calls.  But come January 2021 T-Mobile subscribers will only be able to make VoLTE calls.  I also seem to get 3G speeds even though LTE is indicated is connected and indicated on status bar.  If you dig around settings you can see downstream speeds on status bar.  Wifi is no issue.Fourthly, no wifi calling.  Looked everywhere but can\\'t seem to find it.  And can\\'t send/receive txts over wifi which my old phone could do in case I didn\\'t have a cell signal.Fifth, minor things like the screen aspect ratio is too tall, 20:9 I think.  And it\\'s LCD not OLED like my old phone.  Light does bleed thru on top right hand corner.  Battery life and brightness is not an issue because the battery is big.  I still prefer OLED for better blacks and grays and no light bleeding.Sixth, transferring apps and accounts is not as seamless as with LG.  Every generation LG phone allowed me to transfer and restore all my apps, accounts, email and settings with little follow up thru it\\'s mobile app.  It\\'s the main reason I stuck with LG for so long.  On the Redmi I was only able to transfer and restore my Google account and some apps.  Had to sign in to most of my accounts again unlike the seamlessness of LG app/account restore process.I know I\\'ve focused on the negatives but the positives speak for themselves.  For instance the rear camera is amazing at 64 mp and you can record 4k video if you have the memory.Conclusion, this will be my holdover phone until I upgrade to a 5G.  Either it will be another Redmi or I\\'ll go back to LG when the price is right.Edit: 12-16-20.  Forgot to mention no wireless charging and it\\'s not waterproof, the V30 has it.  But there is a headphone jack.Side note, when I read reviews I usually read the bad reviews first that\\'s why the review skews negative but it isn\\'t so.  There are many features that are not covered more readily explained from other reviews so I won\\'t be repeating them.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I was a little nervous ordering this phone, as I\\'ve had a Samsung Note phone for the last 5 years. I was honestly tired of paying $1k per phone,so I started researching more affordable alternatives and came across Xiaomi Redmi and read all the great reviews and decided to give it\\'s go.  I can definitely say, I am not at all disappointed in my decision. I\\'m quite happy I got this phone, it can definitely go head to head with any top notch phone and gives Samsung a run for their money. I will never buy another Samsung with this far better alternative. The specs, quality and camera... all you get for a 1/4 of the price. Thank you Xiaomi!! You are the Robin Hood of premium phones for the poor and the frugal.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So far I am really pleased with this phone. I wanted a phone that I would be able to get notifications, with nice camera, decent storage and great battery life. It has it all. I have been using it for 2 weeks only, but everything works to my standards. It is bigger than my last phone Huawei (that I started having problems with due to being banned in US ?) but hence the \\\\\"Note\\\\\" phone. I like bigger display, as it is  better to see photos and browse the internet. The side fingerprint sensor works well. Battery life lasts 2.5 days with normal usage. Photos are also nice quality. People can hear me and I can hear them nicely as well. Seller shipped very fast, it came in within 2 days with standard shipping.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Phone is too good.

I like this phone so much more. The camera is better. It is plenty loud enough. Fast and huge battery lasts forever and charges quickly. This must be the best phone on the market below even $800 price points, and all for under $300? It\\'s insane. This phone is by far the best phone I\\'ve owned. And I\\'ve had many.

Wifi is no issue.Fourthly, no wifi calling.  Looked everywhere but can\\'t seem to find it.  And can\\'t send/receive txts over wifi which my old phone could do in case I didn\\'t have a cell signal.Fifth, minor things like the screen aspect ratio is too tall, 20:9 I think.  And it\\'s LCD not OLED like my old phone.  Light does bleed thru on top right hand corner.  Battery life and brightness is not an issue because the battery is big.  I still prefer OLED for better blacks and grays and no light bleeding.Sixth, transferring apps and accounts is not as seamless as with LG.  Every generation LG phone allowed me to transfer and restore all my apps, accounts, email and settings with little follow up thru it\\'s mobile app.  It\\'s the main reason I stuck with LG for so long.  On the Redmi I was only able to transfer and restore my Google account and some apps.  Had to sign in to most of my accounts again unlike the seamlessness of LG app/account restore process.I know I\\'ve focused on the negatives but the positives speak for themselves.  For instance the rear camera is amazing at 64 mp and you can record 4k video if you have the memory.Conclusion, this will be my holdover phone until I upgrade to a 5G.  Either it will be another Redmi or I\\'ll go back to LG when the price is right.Edit: 12-16-20.  Forgot to mention no wireless charging and it\\'s not waterproof, the V30 has it.  But there is a headphone jack.Side note, when I read reviews I usually read the bad reviews first that\\'s why the review skews negative but it isn\\'t so.  There are many features that are not covered more readily explained from other reviews so I won\\'t be repeating them.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So I was a little nervous ordering this phone, as I\\'ve had a Samsung Note phone for the last 5 years. I was honestly tired of paying $1k per phone,so I started researching more affordable alternatives and came across Xiaomi Redmi and read all the great reviews and decided to give it\\'s go.  I can definitely say, I am not at all disappointed in my decision. I\\'m quite happy I got this phone, it can definitely go head to head with any top notch phone and gives Samsung a run for their money. I will never buy another Samsung with this far better alternative. The specs, quality and camera... all you get for a 1/4 of the price. Thank you Xiaomi!! You are the Robin Hood of premium phones for the poor and the frugal.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So far I am really pleased with this phone. I wanted a phone that I would be able to get notifications, with nice camera, decent storage and great battery life. It has it all. I have been using it for 2 weeks only, but everything works to my standards. It is bigger than my last phone Huawei (that I started having problems with due to being banned in US ?) but hence the \\\\\"Note\\\\\" phone. I like bigger display, as it is  better to see photos and browse the internet. The side fingerprint sensor works well. Battery life lasts 2.5 days with normal usage. Photos are also nice quality. People can hear me and I can hear them nicely as well. Seller shipped very fast, it came in within 2 days with standard shipping.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Phone is too good. Little heavy on ur palms. Camera is awesome !! Initially had issues with Play store, however a factory reset fixed the issue. With all features, memory space definitely worth the penny spent.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone is simply amazing. I got it to replace a Galaxy Note 9. Many thought I was crazy. Not at all. I like this phone so much more. The camera is better. It is plenty loud enough. Fast and huge battery lasts forever and charges quickly. This must be the best phone on the market below even $800 price points, and all for under $300? It\\'s insane. This phone is by far the best phone I\\'ve owned. And I\\'ve had many. Even better than the Razer Phone 2. Really impressed.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  excellent phone. boots super quick. runs flawlessbattery life is 1 full day of use. watching netflix, playing some games,and taking pics and texting/smsthe camera is the best ive ever had in a phone.i can take a single pic with 48 MB resolution. yes 48MB !!!the video has 3 angles of adjustment. and with a flip of your finger you can easily go from x2 x1 x1.2 magnification. no fumbling with settings BUT if you need to you can totally adjust ALL the camerassettings with the BASE camera app.it also has built in app cleaning and you can even uninstall apps that other phones put on theirs as bloatware.this last option to remove/uninstall apps already on the phone is the best feature IMO.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Excelente celular, lleg\\\\u00f3 antes del tiempo acordado.

I cannot get in using my email it asks for previous email. After a long time I was finally able to get in without having to return the phone. I downloaded iMyFone LockWiper on my computer and connected it to my phone and I don\\'t know if that worked but Eventually I was able to create a new password and use that one when it asked for the previous password and it worked!

It sounds like a cheap Chinese radio.The most important thing i\\'d like to mention that xiaomi said now they have a new improved vibration motor for better haptic feedback but  on that one is worse than ever. .

The 8 pro still has great battery life almost equal to the G7, and don\\'t believe anyone that reviews  it says it heats up, mine has stayed completely cool. I had a Xiaomi before, but this is a different ballgame. The other phone was a great phone too till I dropped it in the dog\\'s water bowl. This one is water resistant, so hopefully if it happens again I won\\'t have to buy a new phone. If you buy this phone you definitely won\\'t be disappointed.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Hasta el momento todo genial, la bater\\\\u00eda me dura 3 d\\\\u00edas con uso b\\\\u00e1sico normal, la pantalla genial, carga las aplicaciones r\\\\u00e1pidamente, he jugado algunos juegos b\\\\u00e1sicos y ha respondido perfectamente sin retrasos ni atorones, la c\\\\u00e1mara macro es FATAL, HORRIBLE, pr\\\\u00e1cticamente es de adorno, salen much\\\\u00edsimo mejor las fotos con la c\\\\u00e1mara normal acercando el tel\\\\u00e9fono a lo que quieres fotografiar, los videos son buenos, pero con bastante ruido ya en la tarde aunque no sea noche, pero viniendo de un tel\\\\u00e9fono con algunos a\\\\u00f1os de antig\\\\u00fcedad, todo es una mejora en mi experiencia de uso.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  So far so good.Very fast, large screen, great graphic quality, beautiful color, delivered immediately.Very easy set up, I switched my sim card from the old phone to this one, then was able to transfer the data from my old phone to the new phone through Google app.I haven\\'t had much time to play with it yet, so I cannot give a very accurate tech review. I will update in a week or two.Comes with an adapter for the charger.Sent with a case to protect the phone.Bought the extended storage, but have yet to need it. Review on that pending.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Me encanta es un celular grande y muy bonito,r\\\\u00e1pido y en mi pa\\\\u00eds CR la se\\\\u00f1al sin problemas hasta  el momento.Actualizaci\\\\u00f3n.

It is an impressive piece of equipment but cannot live with that much problems.  I did asked Metro PCS if unit would work and was told, as long it is unlock, BS it does not work.  Providers have you control with individual service and make it impossible to connect properly.  Will purchase a phone from them, to avoid hassles.  Unbridle capitalism and monopolies, we all pay for it. .\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I like the phone itself  what I don\\'t like is. Didn\\'t do enough research it is very slow in connecting to a WIFI let\\'s say like Panera bread and the other one is the speaker is at the (BOTTOM) not the TOP  of the phone not in your ear I sometimes have a hard time hearing I point the phone  towards  me it\\'s kinda weird the screen is nice and Brite the redmi is fast in responding\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I purchased this phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro)for a trip from the US to Tanzania, once i got there i went straight to the celluar service provider was hooked up in minutes but the best part is the pictures are EXCELLENT, even the tour guide wanted to use the phone for pics rather than use a camera! Will be going to metro to begin using this phone here in the US rather than the phone I have had for years.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I absolutely love love love this phone! I just returned my Samsung S20 FE with no regrets.Receiving LTE bands on the Space Coast of FL.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This was purchased for my youngest She had a galaxy s7 edge. Price power and reliability for such a cheap price!!!Xiaomi might be my new brand soon as I just got her the phone and want to see how long it lasts.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I\\\\u2019ve had this phone for 3 days now and that is good enough to provide an initial impression.In summary, this is a great piece of tech available at a very reasonable price.  But let me elaborate so that people reading this review can form their own opinionsFirst, I will talk about the looks and the build quality  It is great, the back in particular is so good looking and it reflects light differently at various angles.  Both front and back come with gorilla glass 5 so that should be durable, the front looks very clean and neat.  If I have to find a fault, the only one I can think of is that the side rim is made out of plastic, it is not metal.  First of all, it\\\\u2019s not easy to notice it. Secondly, it shouldn\\\\u2019t cause much concern since the phone still appears to be very sturdy and premium.  Overall, good build quality for the price.Screen quality and brightness  The screen is IPS LCD so obviously it doesn\\\\u2019t have the deep blacks like an AMOLED screen.  It doesn\\\\u2019t even have the kind of contrast that AMOLES has.  But, overall it is still a very high quality screen.  For comparison, I used iPhone XR which has an IPS LCD display and it matches or actually slightly beats it in my opinion.  Outdoor visibility is also very good because it has more than decent brightness.  So again, for the price, this is good.Software and Performance  It comes with a Android version 9 out of the box and it installs a security update immediately after booting up for the first time.  Yes Android 10 is out now and we should ideally have that.  Hopefully, we would get Android 10 on this phone soon through Mi UI new version.  But none of this takes away the software experience.  It is good, it is smooth and nice.  So far I haven\\\\u2019t experienced any slowness or lags.  It is doing a good job.  I installed poco installer which has been very helpful as it is better than Mi UI and has an app drawer which Mi UI doesn\\\\u2019t.Performance is also good, it comes with a dedicated game mode that you can use to bump up the performance while playing games.  Overall, very snappy and can play performance intensive games like subway surfers and asphalt easily.  People have complained it heats up. I have noticed even iPhones heating up when you play such games so it\\\\u2019s not really a concernCameras  It comes with 4 different cameras at the back with the primary one being 64 MP.  I haven\\\\u2019t used the cameras as much yet but have been able to try portrait mode, regular mode, 64 MP mode, wide angle mode and night time photography.  You can say that it is not at par with google or iPhone or Samsung phones but again for the price it is quite good.  Especially the wide angle camera has a nice field of view which allows it to take some great photos.  I just snapped a picture of 40 people standing in a group from up close using wide angle camera and it came out very nice.  For night time, the camera takes some time to take a snap as it is gathering as much light as possible to bring out a nice photo.  So overall it is very good. Happy with the pictures so far.  I have iPhone XS Max and it doesn\\\\u2019t have wide angle and night mode so getting those capabilities here has been good.  Also, the portrait mode is good and it produces good quality images with good blur effect and reasonably good edge detection.  Regarding the selfie camera, the performance  seemed ok, not great. It gives a bit of an artificial effect which is not preferred.  But that\\\\u2019s the only issue I have been able to find so farConnectivity to network  I have T-mobile and this phone works flawlessly on this network. Upload / download speed are very good.  On WiFi you it works very well.Battery and charging speedIt comes with a monster 4500 mAmp battery and damn it is good.  I have already reached screen on time of almost 6 hours and have more than 20% left.  I have done everything, played heavy games, watched a lot of YouTube videos, made phone calls, sent messages, browsed web.  You get an 18W charger in the box but I haven\\\\u2019t been able to use it as it\\\\u2019s not a North American charger.  I used another 27W charger that came with the Essential phone and charging speed is excellent.Other additions  There are a few other things that this phone brings in which possibly other phones don\\\\u2019t .  IR blaster, I used it and it works flawlessly on Samsung TVs.  It also has micro SD expansion slot which I intend to use very soon with fast storage and retrieval.  It comes with a case which is good and you don\\\\u2019t need to buy it separately before the phone arrives.And lastly it comes with a 3.5 mm headphone jack which is also great. Hardly any phones come ms with this now  a days.Overall very happy with the way this phone is shaping up, until nowPlease see some pictures of the phone for better insights\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I upgraded to this phone from a 4 year old mid level phone.  My biggest issue with that one was battery life, so that was a big consideration for me in my new device.  After doing a bunch of searching here on Amazon for an unlocked device, I found this one to have the best combination of cost to feature, after doing plenty of research on the processor.I\\'ve had the unit for a little over a month now, and I can say I am very pleased with the performance and battery life on this phone.  I am not a heavy user of my cell phone as my main media consumption device, and with my personal average use, a 100% charge will last me up to 3 days.  My previous phone was a daily charger.The size of the screen is great, even if it doesn\\'t have the best brightness or contrast, for most people it\\'s going to be good enough.  Same with the camera setup, while not absolutely the best thing ever, it is excellent and takes very clear shots.  The speaker is loud enough for normal use, and the other audio options (Bluetooth and Headphone Jack) have good output as well.  The interface is fast, and feels snappy under normal use.I am is the US on the AT&T network, and had no issues setting up the phone with the micro sim from my previous phone, and didn\\'t have to do anything special to get the unit setup and working.  There is some bloatware on the phone that you can\\'t remove, but you can ignore, which I would suggest.  I would recommend this device to anyone that doesn\\'t \\'need\\' a flagship or apple device.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  There was nothing good about this phone.The Android was completely modified to a point where you can no longer control your device. This phone is filled with bloatware that prevents you from doing centain things and you can\\'t remove any of the bloatware apps, which you have to use.If you want to unlock or enable USB app installation because you are a developer then good luck. You will have to create an account with Xiaomi then register your sim card using your mobile data and have GPS on so they can find your home location. This sounds very sketchy and illegal. They\\'re definitely something\\'s going on with this phone manufacturer. Anytime you want to get the direct system log access it makes you go through bunch of hoops as if they are hiding something.If you are a long time Android user then stay away from Xiaomi phones. After 2019 they completely changed the whole Android OS system in to a black box that logs your activity.If you want to unlock your phone then good luck. Even with creating an account and going through all the steps you still won\\'t be able to unlock your phone. And the worst part is the phone makes you wait 7 days every time you fail to try again. A lot has changed with this company to  point it is no longer the company you once know. I was able unlock OnePlus 3, 5T, 7T, Google pixel 2, Asus Zen Phone etc.. but not this phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Everything checks out. The IMEI # is legit.

It is a beautiful phone and works like the most high-end brand.I love it!!!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Wish I could give this zero stars.I was so excited upon receiving this phone as it\\'s such a good deal and seemed really good quality.A few days after good use, the phone started malfunctioning. It started freezing, and then shutting itself off saying \\\\\"this device is corrupted.\\\\\"And then turning itself back on and then freezing again and then repeating the process etc, over and over again.I\\'m so annoyed, now I won\\'t have a phone for another week.Unfortunately, this phone is a piece of garbage.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This cell phone is the best I have ever had in my life. I used to have Samsung cell phone before years ago so as other brand name phones I\\'ve got from T-Mobile and these worked exactly for a year and were not usable right when the warranty was expiring.I got tired of this and bought my first  off-brand cell phone - ZTE ZMAX - it was a great phone for 2015, much better than Samsung I had prior to it for the fraction of the cost! It worked for 2 years until the battery got fully discharged and I wasn\\'t able to charge it ever again. I then bought Huawei Honor 6x and had it for 3 years. It worked just fine until it started acting with major delays, so I knew it was time to get a new phone.After multiple hours of research I decided to go with Remi Note 8. Thanks to \\\\\"frequency check\\\\\" site I knew I had to get a Global version. I highly recommend to check the phone model and your provider to see how many bands will be supported. I have T-Mobile and any International Version of this phone wasn\\'t working for T-Mobile LTE.Unfortunately Amazon didn\\'t have any Global versions of Redmi Note 8 in stock, so I wend with less memory and Redmi Not 8 Pro. It looks like I overpaid a little because overall prices were high (I blame coronavirus for that lol), but let me tell you - I didn\\'t regret my decision even once because Redmi Note 8 Pro is AMAZING!It feels great - solid, nice, works smooth! I just love it.It takes great pictures. Not as great (real looking) as my Canon Mark II takes, but much better than other phones. Selfies are also great.  The connection is the same as I had with Honor 6x (which supported more LTE bands by the way). I experienced a lost of connection while driving on Interstate as well as in multiple story office building, but it didn\\'t bother me as it happened few times really.The screen feels great to touch. The colors are amazing. Fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone works like a charm. Face recognition feature also works great. Fast browser. Battery life is also great, but my old Honor 6x was giving me full day of usage on one charge. I understand this phone is a huge upgrade from Honor 6x overall because it\\'s been 3 years between these phones which is a huge time frame in technical world, but Redmi Note 9 Pro amazes me every day and I am not even using it to full capacity.I\\'ve got 64 gb one as the price difference for about $45 between this and 128 gb didn\\'t do it for me. I am getting extra memory card which will last me for the duration of this phone\\'s life. After all my old Honor 6x had 32 gb and 64 gm external card and I still was good on memory after 3 years on regular usage.My only doubt is the color. I\\'ve got it in forest green and it\\'s beautiful, but I wanted it in white. Unfortunately the description for white didn\\'t indicate it\\'s a Global version so I wend with green. It still looks pretty cool! Included silicone cover is a bonus. My charger came without US adapter, so I ended up buying 2 for around $5 and now have capability of charging my phone super fast.If you still thinking of buying it... considering newer Redmi Note is about to be announced, don\\'t waste time - this phone is pretty amazing! Hoping it will last for few years.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don\\'t really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile.The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I\\'ve never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi\\'s MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven\\'t tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone is amazing for the price. The fingerprint reader is extremely snappy, scrolling is buttery smooth, and it\\'s lightning fast. Not to mention it\\'s a beautiful piece of tech. I got the green model. My service is with Cricket Wireless in rural Maryland and I\\'m getting all 5 bars of 4G LTE. I\\'m truly impressed by this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a $220 phone with $750 specs. I\\'m a happy camper.Update: After a few weeks using this phone I must say that it gets more amazing every day. I keep finding features while exploring the settings. I wasn\\'t expecting an app drawer but in the settings there is an app drawer option. I\\'m still a happy camper.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  First Chinese phone other than a flagship Samsung and iPhone in over 6 years. couldn\\'t be happier with this Redmi Note 8 Pro. Feels sleek in my hands, easy to navigate, not a ton of bloat ware, and battery lasts over 24 hours in between charges at least for the week I\\'ve had it.It\\'s running Android 9.0 and has already received 1 system update which is nice moving forward. The camera is better than my old Samsung Galaxy 8 which is saying quite a bit.The DDR is 6gb which is less than the newest Galaxy 10 at 8gb, but this phone is blazing fast.

My charger came without US adapter, so I ended up buying 2 for around $5 and now have capability of charging my phone super fast.If you still thinking of buying it... considering newer Redmi Note is about to be announced, don\\'t waste time - this phone is pretty amazing! Hoping it will last for few years.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Great phone for the price. At first I bought an Umidigi budget phone but that did not adequately meet my needs so it was returned. This phone has everything I need for the price. The only thing I took a star off was because the charger is European version and I really expected the phone to already have a screen protector installed like most budget or overseas unlocked phone. The one I got did not, and I don\\'t really feel like having to dish another $10 bucks or so to order a screen protector when the standard has been pre-installed on most or all phones like this. Maybe someone got lazy overseas and did not put one on but now I have to search for one on Amazon and hope that my screen will be okay in the meanwhile.The phone is fast, looks really amazing (I love the green color--I\\'ve never seen this color before on cellphones), and the MIUI is actually not bad even without an app drawer. I do have the Prime Nova Launcher already purchased so eventually I will revert to that launcher but right now just checking out Redmi\\'s MIUI for a feel of it. Right out of the box there was an update to 11 from 10 (I assume the MIUI update). It was a seemless update. So far the signal is good with TMobile for my area and multimedia like Netflix is really snappy and bright. The screen and ratio is good for videos. Haven\\'t tried the camera yet as I am not really a camera person. Will use it eventually and update my review overall in a few weeks or so.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  This phone is amazing for the price. The fingerprint reader is extremely snappy, scrolling is buttery smooth, and it\\'s lightning fast. Not to mention it\\'s a beautiful piece of tech. I got the green model. My service is with Cricket Wireless in rural Maryland and I\\'m getting all 5 bars of 4G LTE. I\\'m truly impressed by this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a $220 phone with $750 specs. I\\'m a happy camper.Update: After a few weeks using this phone I must say that it gets more amazing every day. I keep finding features while exploring the settings. I wasn\\'t expecting an app drawer but in the settings there is an app drawer option. I\\'m still a happy camper.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  First Chinese phone other than a flagship Samsung and iPhone in over 6 years. couldn\\'t be happier with this Redmi Note 8 Pro.

The camera is better than my old Samsung Galaxy 8 which is saying quite a bit.The DDR is 6gb which is less than the newest Galaxy 10 at 8gb, but this phone is blazing fast.

For those on a budget, this phone is great! Just keep your expectations reasonable and  know what you are getting, as it is only Gorilla Glass 3 , not water resistant, and not as fast as say a Pixel 4A or OnePlus bigger flagship phones. It does come with some very cool features , using the Oxygen OS, such as RAM optimization and Game/ Fnatic mode where it will cut off use of all other apps while you game or watch movies, and directs all available resources to the apps you choose. Includes decent cameras (4 total) and a fingerprint read on the back (which I prefer). I have included the 3D Mark Benchmarks for Slingshot and Slingshot Extreme for those interested in raw power / numbers.

In the beginning when I first became a new fan, it was the Samsung S3.  I\\'ve owned the S3, LG G3, S6 Edge, S7 Edge, S8, Note 8, S9, Note 9, S10 Plus, Note 10 Plus, S20 Plus, Note 20 Ultra, and now the S21 Ultra.  What got me on Samsung?  I felt Samsung actually listened to consumers and gave us the room to help with development.  \\\\\"The next best thing\\\\\" It was a work in progress with every release and I felt like I was a part of it.  I was also not an Apple fan with the limited custom features and controls.  Fast forward to the S21 series.  There\\'s a saying, you either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villain.  It appears the entire time, Samsung was the villain in the making.  We knew Samsung wanted to prove Apple wrong, but I didn\\'t realize Samsung wanted to actually become Apple.  They mocked Apple only to follow Apple, what a bunch of hypocrites.  The peak of Samsung when I felt it was the people\\'s company was the S10 plus.  The S10+ offered it all, the little FanBoy items that made me feel life was good with Samsung: headphone jack, heart rate sensor, MST/NFC mobile payment technology, great screen, thin bezel, in screen fingerprint scanner, included AKG headphones, fast charger, and expanded storage.  Do you remember?  Then the slow decline: the Note10 Plus released with no headphone jack and the loss of MST mobile pay.  Then the S20 Plus, no headphone jack, no MST, no heart rate sensor.  And now, the S21 Ultra with no headphone jack, no MST, no heart rate sensor, no headphones, no fast charger and no expandable storage.What have we gain with the S21 Ultra?  At a high cost, the screen is the best smartphone screen in the industry.  Barnone with its 120hz refresh rate and adaptive resolution.  The in-screen fingerprint scanner is upgraded, the camera is now among the best in a very crowded and competitive pool.After using the S21 Ultra for a few days, I was underwhelmed, coming from the S20 Plus.  I found myself missing the S20 Plus, and more the S10 Plus, even with the new upgrades.  I\\'ve lost enthusiasm and confidence in Samsung. The S21 Ultra\\'s weight and size is not for me, I found myself with hand fatigue and not really enjoying using the S21 Ultra.  The SPen support is nice, but come on Samsung, this is a Galaxy S phone.  The Note 20 Ultra is actually the better phone than the S21 Ultra if you want productivity and comfort.There\\'s no doubt the performance is noticeable particularly the high resolution and high refresh rate with the new Snapdragon 888, 12 gigs of memory and faster storage speeds.  But was it an advancement worth upgrading to...my 100% sure answer, definitive no.  There is a lacking of quality and value that I look for and want.  And in a way, Samsung I have a feeling knows that.  The pandemic and consumer behavior may have had something to do with it, but the S21 Ultra despite its advancements, left out too many great distinguishing Samsung features that defined a Samsung Galaxy S-series phone. The pre-order deal was so enticing to me, I jumped on it, with $700 of my old S20plus to trade up, and to also get $260 off of added buys - so I got the Buds Pro, S-pen, and a Samsung Case.  But I\\'ve decided to keep my S20 Plus and paying the difference.What I plan to do now is keep the S21 Ultra as a backup phone and continue to use my S20 Plus and Notw 20 Ultra.  Truth is I still have the S10 Plus and continue to be completely nostalgic about it -- putting my sim card in it from time to time reminiscing how it could\\'ve been instead of where we are now in the Samsung Galaxy S Line Up.Imagine the S21 Ultra having these features:  MTS/NFC payments, heart rate sensor, expandable storage, exceptional camera, best industry screen, IP68, Invictus protection, 120hz refresh rate with high resolution, 5000ma battery and everything else it has.That would be something amazing and exciting!!!If you still own the S10 Plus, keep it, if you own the S20 Plus, keep it.  The S21 Ultra, in my humble opinion is Samsung reducing itself to become the villain.  Don\\'t start another lease agreement,  extend your contract, or get into another debt on the S21 Ultra.  It\\'s harsh and it\\'s my opinion.Rumor is we may not see the next Note this year, which disturbs me even more....stay tuned.  Samsung is trending toward Foldables, which I just don\\'t get.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I start saying \\\\u201cdon\\\\u2019t pay attention to those 1-star reviews, which complain about no dual SIM support, no microSD, no charger, heaviness, etc.\\\\\" We know the specs of what we\\'re buying, if getting a microSD slot is paramount for some, they shouldn\\\\u2019t have bought the S21 in the first place.My experience with this phone has been excellent, having had almost every Galaxy S/Note iteration since 2010, S21 Ultra is no doubt the best smartphone Samsung has ever produced. Great high refresh QHD AMOLED display, solid built, powerful camera system with best-in-class zoom, improved fingerprint sensor, butter smooth interface, more-than-capable Snapdragon chipset, best battery life of any Galaxy S (one day with heavy use and two with light use). Yes, it is a heavy device but nowadays even midrange phones are weighting around 7 oz. Of course it\\\\u2019s not perfect but it\\\\u2019s close, low light photography could be better and should improve with software updates, speakers are just OK for a flagship, it ought to have faster charging capability (45W at least).That\\\\u2019s my summary, if you buy the S21 Ultra, you won\\\\u2019t be disappointed.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  If you\\'re coming from an older galaxy device as I was from the s8+ this upgrade is a HUGE jump. I was hesitant at first due to the lack of SD card expansion and the removal of the iris scanner but really, I\\'m not missing my s8+ at all. The performance is just insane. Processor speed geekbench results are 2-4x the s8+. The display is absolutely gorgeous and the cameras are as well. She\\'s a bit thick and heavy but not in a bad way. The phone feels great, solid in your hand. Very pleased with my decision to finally upgrade. I think the sweetspot may be 3-4 years in between upgrades as you really get A LOT out of it at that point. The differences generation to generation tend to be minimal.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The s21 Ultra is best smartphone on the market, 1440p 120fps oled makes for a screen that looks so good with its high pixel density. blacks are super black, this screen goes really bright too in the sun. really smooth too. one of the best screens I\\'ve ever seen ever. newest 5nm snapdragon 888 processor makes it really fast and efficent. best main camera and telephoto camera ever. bettery life is ok, get like 6 hours sot with 1440p enabled depending how heavy you use your phone. just make sure to go throught the setting and change from fhd+ to qhd+ to get the sharpest display.only thing is its on the large side but doesn\\'t feel that large because its taller than wider.don\\'t get anything less than 256gb because there\\'s no expandable storage.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultras from this seller on a sale for a brand new phone.  It was too good to be true but only a few hundred off.  This phone was meant to be unlocked but T-Mobile and Samsung couldn\\'t understand why it wasn\\'t working.  Upon the boot up screen there was a clue that the software wasn\\'t original. Really glad we didn\\'t put in any banking information, not sure if there was malware or spyware.  Essentially the boot up screen said SAMSUNG GALAXY, only instead of S21 ULTRA which all my old Samsungs had the full title in the boot screen.  At the bottom it said Powered By Android in small letters and showed the little Android dude.  All other Samsungs I\\'ve had say Powered by Android is large white letters.Beware of scams at your cell provider\\'s store as well.  They offered us a buy on e get one that wasn\\'t an available deal.  Would have been stuck with either 2 non working phones with unofficial software or 2 full priced phones I couldn\\'t cancel from the little store.  Do your homework on these large purchases.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I upgraded from the Galaxy s8 to the S21 Ultra with 256 gb of storage and 12gb of ram. I will start off by saying go with the Ultra or the base, you pay $200 extra for half an inch of screen on the plus (this is called decoy price, you see this at movies where the popcorn medium is only 1 dollar less than the large, but is 3 more than the small, so you might as well go large.)I\\'ll give more detial at the end.Camera is super high quality, zoom is incredible. Front camera even takes good pics (I mean I looked good, so should you)Processor is as advertised, insanely fast, even at the standard limited benchmark (there is an enhanced processing mode to take away cpu 70% limit). Desktop mode is great, this phone is almost as fast in Dex as my actual Acer laptop.Battery life is phenomenal, can get 2 full days out of 1 charge if you use the phone less than 4 or 5 hours a day at 1080p res.1440p, super clear and one of the bargaining point for the Ultra over the base. The refresh rate of 120 hz is incredible, I spent the first 10 minutes just swiping on the phone in awe of this. The ultra is also the only version with the curved screen,, the s21 and plus have flat screens.. This phone does an excellent job of cooling, even witha case on. (FYI heat causes the major wear and tear on the internal components like the cpu, so better cooling means better lifespan and performance).Customizable routines allow you to add features to your phone, from automatically silencing when you show up to work or school, automatically going into power save mode at certain times like when you are asleep, or even for when you turn on your Bluetooth headphones your phone can automatically switch to 1440p resolution and turn Dolby atmos on movie mode sound. Dozens of scenarios or time stamps for each feature.If you are the friend that walks on the grass, don\\'t worry about bringing that bulky charger for when your friends\\' phones are about to die, this phone can wireless charge other devices (will stop charging when the phone drops to 30% minimum).If you are concerned about no color options, just remember, I had that beautiful orchid gray s8, and who got to see it? Nobody, because it was hidden behind a lovely teal case for 4 years.If the fact that Samsung dropped their charging from the 45w of the s20 series to a 25w for the s21, rest assured, there is very little added time for charging, and the 25w is less volatile than the 45w. This means, charging does not get the phone as hot, and the battery will have a better lifespan since slower charging is better long term.If you multi task a ton and/or save tons of files, consider spending the extra money to get the 512 gb edition, as it comes with an additional 4gb of ram (16gb total).Ram is what is used to have tabs open, so more ram means more tabs open while still maintaining speed and smoothness. The s21 ultra also has Spen support (need a case that can hold it).Why the ultra or base and not the plus?The s21 has a better ppi (pixel density, higher the density, better the picture) than the s21 plus. They both have the same 8gb of ram, the same storage sizes, same resolution, same cameras, same material, same flat screen, the same backwards wireless charging capability (same for ultra), etc. The only difference is the screen size and that the s21 plus has a 4800 mAh battery while the s21 has a 4000 mAh. The ultra however, offers higher resolution, much higher ppi, the larger screen, larger battery than both (5000mAh). The ultra has much more powerful camera as well, the curved screen, camera features and settings. So if you want all the features and performance and screen resolution (I like the stream movies  on my lunch breaks) then go with the Ultra, if you just want to upgrade to the newest and fastest phone, and you don\\'t need to have 100000 tabs open, get the base s21.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  1. Phone.  Let\\'s not forget it\\'s initial purpose of existence... communication.  I think it\\'s a Verizon thing, but the sound quality of phone calls is uniquely satisfying and clear.2. Signal.  For carrier signal,  for me,  it is much better than my previous 4G device,  the Galaxy S8+. I cannot mention much about the 5G signal nor it\\'s data speeds as the network is still fairly limited in my area.  Wifi is dramatically improved.  Bluetooth,  NFC, GPS, Wifi Hotspot,  and Wifi Direct seem extremely responsive and equally great.3. Performance.  This thing is a power house.  With the dual quad core CPU\\'s, Snapdragon 888 SOC, Qualcomm Adreno 660 GPU, 120 Hz AMOLED display,  everything is snappy and quick.4. Battery.  5000 mAh ought to seem like a lot,  and it is.. Though with the performing hardware mentioned above,  don\\'t expect a solid week\\'s worth of gaming in a device of this caliber.  Power saving features exist for a reason.  Changing your display output to 720, enabling an aggressive power saving mode,  setting your screen brightness to the lowest value,  and limiting yourself to calls only,  you can get several days of use on a single charge.  Without those energy saving measures, expect about half to a full day\\'s use on a single charge.5. Charging.  It lacks a 25 watt super fast charger,  or any charger at all.  It does come with a USC type C to type C cable though.  You get five varying levels of charging:  two with wireless,  three wired.  For wireless,  standard and fast charging.  Wired, standard,  fast,  and super fast.  With super fast,  it can fully charge a dead device in about an hour.  The slowest charge is around three hours.  For longevity,  don\\'t super charge unless absolutely necessary.6. Camera(s). 12,000 x 9,000 pixels is a lot of depth. About 35 MB per photo at 108 megapixels.  There are Pro modes for video and stills as well.  8k at 24fps? I don\\'t get that one.  But a solid 60fps for 4k video is outstanding.  Add the stability feature and you\\'re now a video director and professional cameraman. The video and photos are beyond excellent. The 100x zoom is a comedic gimmick.  Let\\'s get that out there.  The HDR low light photos are superior to any device I have used.  The video has no HDR capture support ):  . Shame.  The macro support is fantastic.  Crisp,  clear images in just about every shot.7. Storage.  This one is tough.  Samsung recently ditched expandable memory,  which really upset me initially.  It\\'s a selling point.  If you intend to use lots of apps,  take lots of photos,  videos,  download oodles of stuff... choose wisely.  If you don\\'t have a computer or infrequently dump your device data to a cloud service or another PC, get more storage.  I settled for the middle ground at 256 GB. After my apps are setup and good to go,  I have about 190 GB of usable storage remaining. Plenty... for now.8. OS. I could sit here and talk about Android 11 and Samsungs TouchWiz UI, but it won\\'t matter.  Software gets updated now frequently than hardware,  and will forever change.  The software on this device is only slightly different from similar devices.  It\\'s much better than previous revisions.  Both Samsung and Android allow for some more aggressive customizations on newer devices. It\\'s nice,  to say the least.9. Features.  Power sharing is nice,  but with its beastly hardware,  you\\'ll likely not want to share your precious battery with anyone,  nor anything else.  It\\'s a neat,  almost useless feature to me. DEX by Samsung is still an infant.  Don\\'t even mess with it.  Link to Windows is cool,  but needs some fine tuning to be better.  You still have a flashlight. That\\'s cool.  The fingerprint reader is neat,  but tricky to learn since it\\'s behind the main display.  It takes a while to get used to.  I wish we could add more than four fingerprints,  or allow more passes for each finger.  It isn\\'t always consistent in every condition.  This phone supports the S-pen and select S-view cases as well.  They\\'re not included,  and are fairly pricey accessories.10. Design. When LG started advertising the Chocolate with Christina Aguilera singing in the background,  I knew phones were competing with cars for our attention in ads.  The corners,  surfaces,  feels,  looks,  sharpness,  and radiant elegance is near perfection.  Dat camera bump,  though.... I almost wish they made a thicker battery,  maybe 8, 000 to 10,000 mAh, to craft a better balance and prevent the offsetting camera bump from existence.  Why does the edge panel have a bubble leveler for this device?  You can\\'t use it! That\\'s just silly.  The camera pimple...I don\\'t like it.  YouTube is the only platform to support HDR10 for a device like this,  and it looks beautiful.  Super bright.  Super sharp.  Super..darn... that pimple is quite noticeable and slightly breaks immersion. This phone weighs less than my previous Galaxy S8+. It\\'s only slightly larger as well.  That\\'s impressive to me.Is it worth a grand?  Considering the fact that I paid as much as I did for my S8+? Yes.  It\\'s a considerable upgrade.  I highly recommend a case.  Especially one that can add balance as to rid itself of the camera bump.  A screen protector is also recommended,  as with any device with such a large display.  I don\\'t care that it has the latest Corning Gorilla Glass on it.  Micro scratches are a thing. And with a display like this,  you will want to preserve its perfections,  even if it has an adolescent pimple on one end.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Bran new phone came scratched right out of the box. Unbelievable.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Great phone bad price as of mid February. Better to get directly from Samsung if you have a trade in.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The battery does not last the whole day at least that you make a lot of comsupntion adjustments, it is a bit heavy and I was expecting better for the fingerprint reader I have a huawei P20 pro and is superior on this point\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The progression and evolution of Samsung has not gone the way I would\\'ve foreseen it.  In the beginning when I first became a new fan, it was the Samsung S3.  I\\'ve owned the S3, LG G3, S6 Edge, S7 Edge, S8, Note 8, S9, Note 9, S10 Plus, Note 10 Plus, S20 Plus, Note 20 Ultra, and now the S21 Ultra.  What got me on Samsung?  I felt Samsung actually listened to consumers and gave us the room to help with development.  \\\\\"The next best thing\\\\\" It was a work in progress with every release and I felt like I was a part of it.  I was also not an Apple fan with the limited custom features and controls.  Fast forward to the S21 series.  There\\'s a saying, you either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villain.  It appears the entire time, Samsung was the villain in the making.  We knew Samsung wanted to prove Apple wrong, but I didn\\'t realize Samsung wanted to actually become Apple.  They mocked Apple only to follow Apple, what a bunch of hypocrites.  The peak of Samsung when I felt it was the people\\'s company was the S10 plus.  The S10+ offered it all, the little FanBoy items that made me feel life was good with Samsung: headphone jack, heart rate sensor, MST/NFC mobile payment technology, great screen, thin bezel, in screen fingerprint scanner, included AKG headphones, fast charger, and expanded storage.  Do you remember?  Then the slow decline: the Note10 Plus released with no headphone jack and the loss of MST mobile pay.  Then the S20 Plus, no headphone jack, no MST, no heart rate sensor.  And now, the S21 Ultra with no headphone jack, no MST, no heart rate sensor, no headphones, no fast charger and no expandable storage.What have we gain with the S21 Ultra?  At a high cost, the screen is the best smartphone screen in the industry.  Barnone with its 120hz refresh rate and adaptive resolution.  The in-screen fingerprint scanner is upgraded, the camera is now among the best in a very crowded and competitive pool.After using the S21 Ultra for a few days, I was underwhelmed, coming from the S20 Plus.  I found myself missing the S20 Plus, and more the S10 Plus, even with the new upgrades.  I\\'ve lost enthusiasm and confidence in Samsung. The S21 Ultra\\'s weight and size is not for me, I found myself with hand fatigue and not really enjoying using the S21 Ultra.  The SPen support is nice, but come on Samsung, this is a Galaxy S phone.  The Note 20 Ultra is actually the better phone than the S21 Ultra if you want productivity and comfort.There\\'s no doubt the performance is noticeable particularly the high resolution and high refresh rate with the new Snapdragon 888, 12 gigs of memory and faster storage speeds.  But was it an advancement worth upgrading to...my 100% sure answer, definitive no.  There is a lacking of quality and value that I look for and want.  And in a way, Samsung I have a feeling knows that.  The pandemic and consumer behavior may have had something to do with it, but the S21 Ultra despite its advancements, left out too many great distinguishing Samsung features that defined a Samsung Galaxy S-series phone. The pre-order deal was so enticing to me, I jumped on it, with $700 of my old S20plus to trade up, and to also get $260 off of added buys - so I got the Buds Pro, S-pen, and a Samsung Case.  But I\\'ve decided to keep my S20 Plus and paying the difference.What I plan to do now is keep the S21 Ultra as a backup phone and continue to use my S20 Plus and Notw 20 Ultra.  Truth is I still have the S10 Plus and continue to be completely nostalgic about it -- putting my sim card in it from time to time reminiscing how it could\\'ve been instead of where we are now in the Samsung Galaxy S Line Up.Imagine the S21 Ultra having these features:  MTS/NFC payments, heart rate sensor, expandable storage, exceptional camera, best industry screen, IP68, Invictus protection, 120hz refresh rate with high resolution, 5000ma battery and everything else it has.That would be something amazing and exciting!!!If you still own the S10 Plus, keep it, if you own the S20 Plus, keep it.  The S21 Ultra, in my humble opinion is Samsung reducing itself to become the villain.  Don\\'t start another lease agreement,  extend your contract, or get into another debt on the S21 Ultra.  It\\'s harsh and it\\'s my opinion.Rumor is we may not see the next Note this year, which disturbs me even more....stay tuned.  Samsung is trending toward Foldables, which I just don\\'t get.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I start saying \\\\u201cdon\\\\u2019t pay attention to those 1-star reviews, which complain about no dual SIM support, no microSD, no charger, heaviness, etc.\\\\\" We know the specs of what we\\'re buying, if getting a microSD slot is paramount for some, they shouldn\\\\u2019t have bought the S21 in the first place.My experience with this phone has been excellent, having had almost every Galaxy S/Note iteration since 2010, S21 Ultra is no doubt the best smartphone Samsung has ever produced. Great high refresh QHD AMOLED display, solid built, powerful camera system with best-in-class zoom, improved fingerprint sensor, butter smooth interface, more-than-capable Snapdragon chipset, best battery life of any Galaxy S (one day with heavy use and two with light use). Yes, it is a heavy device but nowadays even midrange phones are weighting around 7 oz. Of course it\\\\u2019s not perfect but it\\\\u2019s close, low light photography could be better and should improve with software updates, speakers are just OK for a flagship, it ought to have faster charging capability (45W at least).That\\\\u2019s my summary, if you buy the S21 Ultra, you won\\\\u2019t be disappointed.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  If you\\'re coming from an older galaxy device as I was from the s8+ this upgrade is a HUGE jump. I was hesitant at first due to the lack of SD card expansion and the removal of the iris scanner but really, I\\'m not missing my s8+ at all. The performance is just insane. Processor speed geekbench results are 2-4x the s8+. The display is absolutely gorgeous and the cameras are as well. She\\'s a bit thick and heavy but not in a bad way. The phone feels great, solid in your hand. Very pleased with my decision to finally upgrade. I think the sweetspot may be 3-4 years in between upgrades as you really get A LOT out of it at that point. The differences generation to generation tend to be minimal.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The s21 Ultra is best smartphone on the market, 1440p 120fps oled makes for a screen that looks so good with its high pixel density. blacks are super black, this screen goes really bright too in the sun. really smooth too. one of the best screens I\\'ve ever seen ever. newest 5nm snapdragon 888 processor makes it really fast and efficent. best main camera and telephoto camera ever. bettery life is ok, get like 6 hours sot with 1440p enabled depending how heavy you use your phone. just make sure to go throught the setting and change from fhd+ to qhd+ to get the sharpest display.only thing is its on the large side but doesn\\'t feel that large because its taller than wider.don\\'t get anything less than 256gb because there\\'s no expandable storage.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultras from this seller on a sale for a brand new phone.  It was too good to be true but only a few hundred off.  This phone was meant to be unlocked but T-Mobile and Samsung couldn\\'t understand why it wasn\\'t working.  Upon the boot up screen there was a clue that the software wasn\\'t original. Really glad we didn\\'t put in any banking information, not sure if there was malware or spyware.  Essentially the boot up screen said SAMSUNG GALAXY, only instead of S21 ULTRA which all my old Samsungs had the full title in the boot screen.  At the bottom it said Powered By Android in small letters and showed the little Android dude.  All other Samsungs I\\'ve had say Powered by Android is large white letters.Beware of scams at your cell provider\\'s store as well.  They offered us a buy on e get one that wasn\\'t an available deal.  Would have been stuck with either 2 non working phones with unofficial software or 2 full priced phones I couldn\\'t cancel from the little store.  Do your homework on these large purchases.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I upgraded from the Galaxy s8 to the S21 Ultra with 256 gb of storage and 12gb of ram. I will start off by saying go with the Ultra or the base, you pay $200 extra for half an inch of screen on the plus (this is called decoy price, you see this at movies where the popcorn medium is only 1 dollar less than the large, but is 3 more than the small, so you might as well go large.)I\\'ll give more detial at the end.Camera is super high quality, zoom is incredible. Front camera even takes good pics (I mean I looked good, so should you)Processor is as advertised, insanely fast, even at the standard limited benchmark (there is an enhanced processing mode to take away cpu 70% limit). Desktop mode is great, this phone is almost as fast in Dex as my actual Acer laptop.Battery life is phenomenal, can get 2 full days out of 1 charge if you use the phone less than 4 or 5 hours a day at 1080p res.1440p, super clear and one of the bargaining point for the Ultra over the base. The refresh rate of 120 hz is incredible, I spent the first 10 minutes just swiping on the phone in awe of this. The ultra is also the only version with the curved screen,, the s21 and plus have flat screens.. This phone does an excellent job of cooling, even witha case on. (FYI heat causes the major wear and tear on the internal components like the cpu, so better cooling means better lifespan and performance).Customizable routines allow you to add features to your phone, from automatically silencing when you show up to work or school, automatically going into power save mode at certain times like when you are asleep, or even for when you turn on your Bluetooth headphones your phone can automatically switch to 1440p resolution and turn Dolby atmos on movie mode sound. Dozens of scenarios or time stamps for each feature.If you are the friend that walks on the grass, don\\'t worry about bringing that bulky charger for when your friends\\' phones are about to die, this phone can wireless charge other devices (will stop charging when the phone drops to 30% minimum).If you are concerned about no color options, just remember, I had that beautiful orchid gray s8, and who got to see it? Nobody, because it was hidden behind a lovely teal case for 4 years.If the fact that Samsung dropped their charging from the 45w of the s20 series to a 25w for the s21, rest assured, there is very little added time for charging, and the 25w is less volatile than the 45w. This means, charging does not get the phone as hot, and the battery will have a better lifespan since slower charging is better long term.If you multi task a ton and/or save tons of files, consider spending the extra money to get the 512 gb edition, as it comes with an additional 4gb of ram (16gb total).Ram is what is used to have tabs open, so more ram means more tabs open while still maintaining speed and smoothness. The s21 ultra also has Spen support (need a case that can hold it).Why the ultra or base and not the plus?The s21 has a better ppi (pixel density, higher the density, better the picture) than the s21 plus. They both have the same 8gb of ram, the same storage sizes, same resolution, same cameras, same material, same flat screen, the same backwards wireless charging capability (same for ultra), etc. The only difference is the screen size and that the s21 plus has a 4800 mAh battery while the s21 has a 4000 mAh. The ultra however, offers higher resolution, much higher ppi, the larger screen, larger battery than both (5000mAh). The ultra has much more powerful camera as well, the curved screen, camera features and settings. So if you want all the features and performance and screen resolution (I like the stream movies  on my lunch breaks) then go with the Ultra, if you just want to upgrade to the newest and fastest phone, and you don\\'t need to have 100000 tabs open, get the base s21.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  1.

You haven\\'t been scammed if you don\\'t find the wired headphones  in the box!Original review: I say it\\'s the best, with a grain of salt, read the cons to know why!To start off, Samsung did an amazing job with this phone, so much that they rendered the fairly new, still very expensive, S20 Ultra, almost obsolete!But I\\'m not gonna review both units here, so for those of you looking for quick pros & cons, here you go.Pros:- AMAZING display, I had so many high end phones, including the IPhone 11 pro max and Google Pixel 4XL & even the note 10, but this screen here bests all of them. The high refresh rate, the beautiful colors, and the better ratio (it\\'s a little wider than the S20 ultra for example), all this makes for an outstanding screen.- Great main camera. The pictures are just perfect in almost all light conditions. I dunno how much better is the 108 MP mode, it bothered me a little that cropping a 108 MP picture didn\\'t yield the perfect result, but all in all, the camera is top notch, in all its modes. The videos are even better. You won\\'t find a phone with a better main camera on the market.- The S pen is pretty useful for taking notes! I didn\\'t feel like I needed it for anything else except, may be, for a selfie, so eventhough it isn\\'t the biggest selling point, it\\'s worth mentioning.- It looks great! Yup, design wise, that phone looks really good, that it feels bad putting any covers on it. I personally just ordered a very slim, transparent case & I wouldn\\'t recommend anything else.There are some added gimmicky features that you can find almost everywhere online, but I personally loved the direct share, where I can show anything I want from my phone and cast it to a smart TV or one with a Google chrome cast attached to it, it happened a lot before that I needed to show many people at the same time, whatever it is that was on my phone, photos or a certain app, and that feature here makes it so easy.Cons:- I dunno how this isn\\'t mentioned anywhere, but the selfie camera isn\\'t great at all in low light conditions. Yes in the morning, outdoor, it is very good, but other than that it\\'s just not great! I could see myself buying the next Google Pixel instead, just for this.- Battery life isn\\'t good enough either. It\\'s worse than my S20 Ultra, and it was no surprise, since Samsung decided to give this phone a smaller battery \\\\ud83d\\\\ude44I find myself charging it twice a day, which really isn\\'t practical.Just for those 2 points, added to the fact that it\\'s a super expensive phone, I had to give it 4 stars.Now if it gets the Google Pixel software for the selfie camera, and a full day of battery life that would have been the best phone ever made! But I guess we\\'ll have to wait for next year for that!\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\u00a0I got this on launch day and it had a defect where the S pen wasn\\'t registering in a large circular area on the screen. Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I\\'m done with it. I\\'ve had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I do not recommend buying.  the charger stopped working after just 2 hours of use.  and did not bring the headphones.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Purchased new phone, arrived damaged. Deceptively packaged with screen protectors. Pay very close attention to the device you receive.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.I would definitely recommend a solid case if you\\'re planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).Other thoughts: I think it\\'s interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can\\'t say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it\\'s important enough to you. For me it is, and I\\'m very happy with this phone.Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone\\'s specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you\\'re somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, & screen quality that money can buy you right now.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Whites are a bit dull not as bright as my note 10+ .poor battery life, takes too long to charge.

It\\'s 4gb of ram! Not 6gb! Customer support from BREED is utter garbageWill change review if something is done EDIT: THEY CHANGED IT TO NOT SHOW 6GB BUT CHARGE SAME PRICE FOR 4GB\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I purchased the 128GB with 4GB ram model in all black.  My wife\\'s S8+ that was close to becoming non-functional and I needed a new phone asap.  I had previously purchased an A20s for my son and so I first ordered the A30s until I did some research regarding my mobile provider T-Mobile in the US.I cancelled the A30s and got the A51 primarily because of the supported LTE bands. T-Mobile uses the following bands2, 4, 5, 12, 66, 71The A30s only supports band 5 from the that list!However, the A51 supports band 2, 4, 5, 12 and 66.  I was gladly willing to pay a little more to ensure I had maximum connectivity with my carrier so I cancelled the A30s and purchased the A51 instead.Now with that primary consideration out of the way, on to the rest of the review.  I\\'ll start with the best parts first.1.  Call quality, reception and connectivityThe call quality is excellent on this phone, right up there with my s10+.  I think the microphone quality has been improved because my wife loves using the speakerphone and on her hold s8+, her voice occasionally cut out here and there as the mic tried to pick up her voice.  Also, the sound quality of the voice has improved as well which further helps to understand the conversation.  Reception has been about the same compared to my s10+, which is to say pretty good.  We measured on signel strength and asu.  The mobile data speeds are excellent even in areas that are typically weaker in signal strength.2.  ScreenSamsung AMOLEDs are the best in the business when it comes to screen quality.  We are a little relieved the screen is not curved because this allows us to get a robust case to protect everything.  The colors, quality and resolution are all indistuingishable compared to my s10+.  The front camera is a tiny pinhole so the entire body is pretty much all screen.  There is an in-screen fingerprint reader which is optical, rather than infrasonic on my s10+ but it is still reasonably fast to unlock the phone.  Yes it is slightly slower than my s10+ but we\\'re talking milliseconds of difference.3.  General usabilityMy wife is not a gamer so I can\\'t say anything about the gaming experience but she does use a ton of media and productivity apps.  For all of her use on them so far, she says they feel snappy.  They all open fast and transition well and she multitasks as much as before without a shred of difference.  When we first setup the phone, we were concerned because there was some UI lag but realized a lot of processing was being used during the Samsung Switch, which transfered her entire old phone to the new phone.  Once the switch was done, we rebooted and the phone was responsive and fast.4.  CameraThe camera hardware has some beefy specs.  But for a mostly point-and-shooter, it\\'s hard to really go wrong many camera setups.  Picture quality looks great in the light and not as good in the dark compared to my s10+.  The slower camera speed is noticeable, transitioning between the main camera/wide/macro takes about a half second, where on my s10+ is pretty much instant.  The shutter is just as fast, luckily.  If camera speeds are important to you, you would probably not be happy with this phone.5.  BatteryI have to admit, we were looking forward to getting more usable time out of the battery.  The battery is 4000mah unit and the s8+ was only 3500mah.  However, through the typical daily use, we found that the end-of-day percentage left were about the same.  We average about 4 hours of on-screen time scattered throughout the day with app use and web-browsing and the battery was around 40% left, which is the same as the s8+.  If long battery life is important to you, you would not be happy with this phone but keep in mind, it can easily last an entire busy day on a single charge.Overall, we like the phone for the price of under $300.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  LTE working on T-Mobile in US with Mint mobile, after configuring APN!Great budget phone with a fantastic screen and pretty decent camera, and enough ram for the typical person.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I researched this exact model and every website says that this model comes with NFC, but it doesn\\'t. I noticed a customer ask the question if this model has NFC and it seems it was the seller who said it does have NFC. This phone is an international phone and it has some things in the settings that are in Spanish when I chose \\\\\"English\\\\\" in the setup. This phone also came with Android Auto preinstalled, but there is no way to open the app. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn\\'t help either. Not pleased that this phone doesn\\'t have NFC and the fact it has software bugs and it cost me $300 before tax. There are other phones out there for a lower price and even better specs. Not sure if will buy another Samsung phone after this experience.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  I\\'m happy with my purchase however I received the wrong color I ordered the black one but I do find the blue pretty so I\\'ll be keeping it...phone works excellent on cricket wireless in Pennsylvania...I will recommend this phone.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  After learning about the A51 differences I would like to say that model SM-A515F/DS has 128GB internal storage, 4GB of RAM and doesn\\'t have NFC setting. Model SM-A515F/DSN has 128GB internal storage, 6GB of RAM and has the NFC setting.I purchased the Samsung Galaxy A51 Prism Crush Black phone April 27, 2020 and two days later the phone was at my doorstep (just the phone). The box came in completely sealed and it had all the accessories. After going through all the configuration (I did not setup fingerprint or face recognition at the beginning) I was in business. The colors on the Samsung Galaxy A51 are amazing. I did make a change under Settings > Display > Screen Mode, from Natural to Vivid and turn on Dark Mode. The fingerprint is under Settings > Biometrics and Security > Fingerprints. It took me a while to be able to setup fingerprint. Honestly did it like 30 times until it read 100%. You will have to move the finger to different angles until it reads your fingerprint completely. Every time it reads new lines the percentage goes higher. Once I was done, I tested it and it worked fine. I used all other 9 fingers different angles to see if it would let me login, and it DID NOT. The phone does take great pictures. I tested the macro on one of my dogs nose and WOW, the pic was stunning. The pic of a lizard was taken in macro. Calls are clear and it shows LTE with strong signal.  I am registered with MetroPCS and my dad with AT&T. I used my dad\\'s AT&T sim card and it worked (picture shows Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T).The phone does have 4GB of RAM. When I purchased mine the price had drop to the point I couldn\\'t pass it. I didn\\'t see anything on Amazon page at that time, but I don\\'t care, I\\'m very happy with the phone.Aside from the A51, I purchased a Feitenn Samsung Galaxy A51 Metal Case (ASIN B0839C38GM). The case is sturdy and it DOES protect the phone. The screen protector IS NOT attached (together) to the metal case like it shows on the pictures, and the screen protector IS NOT gorilla glass, it is just regular and it doesn\\'t have the whole for the front camera. I placed an order for 3 Tempered Glass (ASIN B082S7NCB8).Thanks\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\n\\\\n  Got the phone, 4 gig ram, might not be a such thing as 6 gig .
